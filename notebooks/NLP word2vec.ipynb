The weakness affects both the left and right sides of your body, and tends to gradually worsen.\\n': 'Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases', \"Signs and symptoms of morphea vary depending on the type and stage of the condition. They include:\\nReddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back\\nPatches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center\\nLinear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp\\nA gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny\\nMorphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone. The condition generally lasts several years and then improves or at times disappears by itself. It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin. It is possible for morphea to recur.See your doctor if you notice reddish patches of hardening or thickening skin. Early diagnosis and treatment may help slow the development of new patches and allow your doctor to identify and treat complications before they worsen.The cause of morphea is unknown. It may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system. In people at increased risk of morphea, it could be triggered by injury to the affected area, medications, chemical toxins, an infection or radiation therapy.The condition isn't contagious.Certain factors may affect your risk of developing morphea, including:\\nBeing white and female. Morphea is most common in white females.\\nAge. The condition can affect people at any age. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 14 or in the mid-40s.\\nA family history of morphea. This condition can run in families. People with morphea are more likely to have a family history of morphea and other autoimmune diseases.\\nMorphea can cause a number of complications, including:\\nSelf-esteem issues. Morphea can have a negative effect on your self-esteem and body image, particularly if discolored patches of skin appear on your arms, legs or face.\\nMovement problems. Morphea that affects the arms or legs can impair joint mobility.\\nWidespread areas of hardened, discolored skin. Numerous new patches of hardened, discolored skin may seem to join together, a condition known as generalized morphea.\\nLoss of hair and sweat glands. Over time, you may lose hair and sweat glands in the affected area.\\nEye damage.

Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see.\\nNumb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming or stress relief.\\nDuring an attack of Raynaud's, affected areas of the skin usually first turn pale. Next, they often change color and feel cold and numb. When the skin warms and blood flow improves, the affected areas may change color again, throb, tingle or swell.Raynaud's most commonly affects fingers and toes. But it also can affect other areas of the body, such as nose, lips, ears and even nipples. After warming up, the return of blood flow to the area can take 15 minutes.See your health care provider right away if you have a history of severe Raynaud's and get a sore or infection in one of your affected fingers or toes.Experts don't fully understand the cause of Raynaud's attacks. But blood vessels in the hands and feet appear to react too strongly to cold temperatures or stress.With Raynaud's, arteries to the fingers and toes narrow when exposed to cold or stress. The narrowed arteries limit blood flow. Over time, these small arteries can thicken slightly and limit blood flow even more.\\n\": 'Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases', \"Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:\\nTender, warm, swollen joints\\nJoint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity\\nFatigue, fever and loss of appetite\\nEarly rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first â\\x80\\x94 particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet.As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body.About 40% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Areas that may be affected include:\\nSkin\\nEyes\\nLungs\\nHeart\\nKidneys\\nSalivary glands\\nNerve tissue\\nBone marrow\\nBlood vessels\\nRheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission â\\x80\\x94 when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place.Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints.Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Normally, your immune system helps protect your body from infection and disease. In rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your joints. It can also cause medical problems with your heart, lungs, nerves, eyes and skin.Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more likely to react to environmental factors â\\x80\\x94 such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria â\\x80\\x94 that may trigger the disease.Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include:\\nYour sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis.\\nAge. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins in middle age.\\nFamily history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease.\\nSmoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity.\\nExcess weight. People who are overweight appear to be at a somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.\\nRheumatoid arthritis increases your risk of developing:\\nOsteoporosis. Rheumatoid arthritis itself, along with some medications used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, can increase your risk of osteoporosis â\\x80\\x94 a condition that weakens your bones and makes them more prone to fracture.\\nRheumatoid nodules. These firm bumps of tissue most commonly form around pressure points, such as the elbows. However, these nodules can form anywhere in the body, including the heart and lungs.\\nDry eyes and mouth. People who have rheumatoid arthritis are much more likely to develop Sjogren's syndrome, a disorder that decreases the amount of moisture in the eyes and mouth.\\nInfections. Rheumatoid arthritis itself and many of the medications used to combat it can impair the immune system, leading to increased infections. Protect yourself with vaccinations to prevent diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, shingles and COVID-19.\\nAbnormal body composition. The proportion of fat to lean mass is often higher in people who have rheumatoid arthritis, even in those who have a normal body mass index (BMI).\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. If rheumatoid arthritis affects your wrists, the inflammation can compress the nerve that serves most of your hand and fingers.\\nHeart problems. Rheumatoid arthritis can increase your risk of hardened and blocked arteries, as well as inflammation of the sac that encloses your heart.\\nLung disease. People with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk of inflammation and scarring of the lung tissues, which can lead to progressive shortness of breath.\\nLymphoma. Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphoma, a group of blood cancers that develop in the lymph system.\\n\\n\\n\": 'Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases', \"hardening and tightening of the skin at the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. \\nHeartburn\\nDifficulty swallowing\\nBloating\\nDiarrhea\\nConstipation\\nFecal incontinence\\nWhen scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men.\": 'Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases', nan: 'Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites', '\\nAn itchy rash\\nLeathery patches that are darker than usual (hyperpigmented), typically on brown or Black skin\\nDry, cracked, scaly skin, typically on white skin\\nBumps and blisters, sometimes with oozing and crusting\\nSwelling, burning or tenderness\\n': 'Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites', 'Speckled line of red spots or pimples on your skin.\\nBites located where clothing tightly fits on your body.\\nSevere itch.': 'Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites', 'Red, twisting lesions that grow.

With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors â\\x80\\x94 such as tobacco smoke.In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function.A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms.Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn't contagious.The main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk.Complications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include:\\nAsthma and hay fever. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.\\nFood allergies. People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).\\nChronic itchy, scaly skin. A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.\\nPatches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area. This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.\\nSkin infections. Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.\\nIrritant hand dermatitis. This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.\\nAllergic contact dermatitis. This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.\\nSleep problems. The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.\\nMental health conditions. Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis.\\nDeveloping a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing:\\n\\nMoisturize your skin at least twice a day. Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. Choose a product or products that work well for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented.\\nUsing petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis.\\n\\nTake a daily bath or shower. Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.\\nUse a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean â\\x80\\x94 no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.\\nPat dry. After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).\\nThe triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare.Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include:\\nRough wool fabric\\nDry skin\\nSkin infection\\nHeat and sweat\\nStress\\nCleaning products\\nDust mites and pet dander\\nMold\\nPollen\\nSmoke from tobacco\\nCold and dry air\\nFragrances\\nOther irritating chemicals\\nInfants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow's milk. Talk with your child's health care provider about identifying potential food allergies.Once you understand what triggers your eczema, talk with your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms and prevent flares.\\n\\n\": 'Atopic Dermatitis', \"Contact dermatitis shows up on skin that has been directly exposed to the substance causing the reaction. For example, the rash may show up along a leg that brushed against poison ivy. The rash can develop within minutes to hours of exposure, and it can last 2 to 4 weeks.Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis vary widely and may include:\\nAn itchy rash\\nLeathery patches that are darker than usual (hyperpigmented), typically on brown or Black skin\\nDry, cracked, scaly skin, typically on white skin\\nBumps and blisters, sometimes with oozing and crusting\\nSwelling, burning or tenderness\\nSee your health care provider if:\\nThe rash is so itchy that you can't sleep or go about your day\\nThe rash is severe or widespread\\nYou're worried about how your rash looks\\nThe rash doesn't get better within three weeks\\nThe rash involves the eyes, mouth, face or genitals\\nSeek immediate medical care in the following situations:\\nYou think your skin is infected. Clues include fever and pus oozing from blisters.\\nIt's hard to breathe after inhaling burning weeds.\\nYour eyes or nasal passages hurt after inhaling smoke from burning poison ivy.\\nYou think an ingested substance has damaged the lining of your mouth or digestive tract.\\nContact dermatitis is caused by exposure to a substance that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction. The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants. Often people have irritant and allergic reactions at the same time.Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common type. This nonallergic skin reaction occurs when an irritant damages your skin's outer protective layer.Some people react to strong irritants after a single exposure. Others may develop a rash after repeated exposures to even mild irritants, such as soap and water. And some people develop a tolerance to the substance over time.Common irritants include:\\nSolvents\\nRubber gloves\\nBleach and detergents\\nHair products\\nSoap\\nAirborne substances\\nPlants\\nFertilizers and pesticides\\nAllergic contact dermatitis occurs when a substance to which you're sensitive (allergen) triggers an immune reaction in your skin. It often affects only the area that came into contact with the allergen. But it may be triggered by something that enters your body through foods, flavorings, medicine, or medical or dental procedures (systemic contact dermatitis).People often become sensitized to allergens after many contacts with it over years. Once you develop an allergy to a substance, even a small amount of it can cause a reaction.Common allergens include:\\nNickel, which is used in jewelry, buckles and many other items\\nMedications, such as antibiotic creams\\nBalsam of Peru, which is used in many products, such as perfumes, toothpastes, mouth rinses and flavorings\\nFormaldehyde, which is in preservatives, cosmetics and other products\\nPersonal care products, such as body washes, hair dyes and cosmetics\\nPlants such as poison ivy and mango, which contain a highly allergenic substance called urushiol\\nAirborne allergens, such as ragweed pollen and spray insecticides\\nProducts that cause a reaction when you're in the sun (photoallergic contact dermatitis), such as some sunscreens and cosmetics\\nChildren develop allergic contact dermatitis from the usual offenders and also from exposure to diapers, baby wipes, jewelry used in ear piercing, clothing with snaps or dyes, and so on.The risk of contact dermatitis may be higher in people who have certain jobs and hobbies. Examples include:\\nAgricultural workers\\nCleaners\\nConstruction workers\\nCooks and others who work with food\\nFlorists\\nHair stylists and cosmetologists\\nHealth care workers, including dental workers\\nMachinists\\nMechanics\\nScuba divers or swimmers, due to the rubber in face masks or goggles\\nContact dermatitis can lead to an infection if you repeatedly scratch the affected area, causing it to become wet and oozing. This creates a good place for bacteria or fungi to grow and may cause an infection.You can take the following steps to help prevent contact dermatitis:\\nAvoid irritants and allergens. Try to identify and avoid the cause of your rash. For ear and body piercings, use jewelry made of hypoallergenic material, such as surgical steel or gold.\\nWash your skin. For poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac, you might be able to remove most of the rash-causing substance if you wash your skin right away after coming into contact with it. Use a mild, fragrance-free soap and warm water. Rinse completely. Also wash any clothing or other items that may have come into contact with a plant allergen, such as poison ivy.\\nWear protective clothing or gloves. Face masks, goggles, gloves and other protective items can shield you from irritating substances, including household cleansers.\\nApply an iron-on patch to cover metal fasteners next to your skin. This can help you avoid a reaction to jean snaps, for example.\\nApply a barrier cream or gel. These products can provide a protective layer for your skin. For example, a nonprescription skin cream containing bentoquatam (Ivy Block) may prevent or lessen your skin's reaction to poison ivy.\\nUse moisturizer.

Use warm, not hot, water. Rinse and pat dry. Try to bathe no more than once a day.\\nUse a gentle cleanser or allergen-free soap. Try a nonsoap cleansing cream or shower gel. Or use fragrance-free moisturizing soap with no alcohol or allergy-causing substances (hypoallergenic soap), especially if you handwash often. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Apply a moisturizing cream while your skin is still damp.\\nShave with care. Shaving can be drying. If you shave, use a lubricating agent before you start. Shave in the direction of hair growth, unless that irritates your skin. Use a sharp blade and rinse it with warm water after each stroke. When done, apply moisturizer.\\nCover as much skin as possible in cold or windy weather. Harsh weather can be especially drying to skin. Scarves, hats, and gloves or mittens help protect your skin when you\\'re outdoors.\\nWear gloves. Protect your hands with suitable gloves when gardening, using harsh cleansers and doing other skin-drying activities.\\nRinse and moisturize after swimming.

In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:\\nHeartburn\\nDifficulty swallowing\\nBloating\\nDiarrhea\\nConstipation\\nFecal incontinence\\nWhen scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men. Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma:\\nGenetics. People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. This may explain why a small number of scleroderma cases appear to run in families and why some types of scleroderma are more common for certain ethnic groups.\\nEnvironmental triggers. Research suggests that, in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medications or drugs. Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. An environmental trigger is not identified for most people.\\nImmune system problems. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. People who have scleroderma may also have symptoms of another autoimmune disease â\\x80\\x94 such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome.\\nScleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the:\\nFingertips. In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die.\\nLungs. Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs.\\nKidneys. A serious kidney complication (scleroderma renal crisis) involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function.\\nHeart. Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure. Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart.\\nTeeth. Severe tightening of facial skin can cause your mouth to become smaller and narrower, which may make it hard to brush your teeth or to even have them professionally cleaned. People who have scleroderma often don't produce normal amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more.\\nDigestive system. Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine.\\nJoints.

The lesions can also join together.This is a rapidly progressive type of morphea with many plaques that can cover almost your entire body. It spares hands and feet. This type needs the most aggressive treatment.Linear morphea features a single band of thickened, discolored skin. Usually, the indented band runs down an arm or leg, but it might also extend down your forehead.

Common reported triggers for these flares include sun exposure, emotional stress, cold or hot weather, alcohol, spicy foods, exercise, wind, cosmetics, and hot baths or hot drinks. These symptoms persist throughout other phases of the disorder. In the vascular phase, patients develop facial erythema and edema with multiple telangiectases, possibly as a result of persistent vasomotor instability.   An inflammatory phase often follows, in which sterile papules and pustules (leading to the designation of rosacea as adult acne) develop.   The late phase (developing in some patients), is characterized by coarse tissue hyperplasia of the cheeks and nose (rhinophyma) caused by tissue inflammation, collagen deposition, and sebaceous gland hyperplasia.   The phases of rosacea are usually sequential. Some patients go directly into the inflammatory stage, bypassing the earlier stages. Treatment may cause rosacea to return to an earlier stage. Progression to the late stage is not inevitable.

Severe disease is characterized by dysphagia, dysphonia, and/or diaphragmatic weakness. Muscle weakness may progress over weeks to months. However, it takes destruction of 50% of muscle fibers to cause symptomatic weakness (ie, muscle weakness indicates advanced myositis). Patients may have difficulty raising their arms above their shoulders, climbing steps, or rising from a sitting position. Sometimes muscle tenderness and atrophy develop. Patients may require the use of a wheelchair or become bedridden because of weakness of pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. The flexors of the neck may be severely affected, causing an inability to raise the head from the pillow. Involvement of pharyngeal and upper esophageal muscles may impair swallowing and predispose to aspiration. Muscles of the hands, feet, and face are not involved except in inclusion body myositis, in which distal involvement, especially of the hands, is characteristic. Limb contractures rarely develop.

Skin changes, which occur in dermatomyositis, tend to be dusky and erythematous. Photosensitivity and skin ulceration are visible. Periorbital edema with a purplish appearance (heliotrope rash) is relatively specific for dermatomyositis. Elsewhere, the rash may be slightly elevated and smooth or scaly; it may appear on the forehead, V of the neck and shoulders, chest and back, forearms and lower legs, lateral thighs, elbows and knees, medial malleoli, and dorsal aspects of the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints (Gottron papulesâ\\x80\\x94a relatively specific finding). The base and sides of the fingernails may be hyperemic or thickened. Desquamating dermatitis with splitting of the skin may evolve over the radial aspects of the fingers. Subcutaneous and muscle calcification may occur, particularly in children. The primary skin lesions frequently fade completely but may be followed by secondary changes (eg, brownish pigmentation, atrophy, persistent neovascularization, scarring).

Systemic symptoms include generalized afternoon fatigue and malaise, anorexia, generalized weakness, and occasionally low-grade fever. Joint symptoms include pain, swelling, and stiffness. Occasionally, the disease begins abruptly, mimicking an acute viral syndrome. The disease progresses most rapidly during the first 6 years, particularly the first year; 80% of patients develop some permanent joint abnormalities within 10 years. The course is unpredictable in individual patients. Joint symptoms are characteristically symmetric. Typically, stiffness lasts > 60 minutes after rising in the morning but may occur after any prolonged inactivity (called gelling). Involved joints become tender, with erythema, warmth, swelling, and limitation of motion. The joints primarily involved include the following:  Wrists and the index (2nd) and middle (3rd) metacarpophalangeal joints (most commonly involved) Proximal interphalangeal joints Metatarsophalangeal joint Shoulders Elbows Hips Knees Ankles However, virtually any joint, except the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, may be involved.

Not all bites inject venom, but if the wound oozes, venom was probably injected. Redness and swelling usually follow within 30 to 60 minutes and can affect the entire leg or arm within several hours. Moderate or severe pit viper poisoning commonly causes bruising of the skin 3 to 6 hours after the bite. The skin around the bite appears tight and discolored. Blisters, often filled with blood, may form in the bite area. Without treatment, tissue around the bite may be destroyed. Other symptoms include fever, chills, general weakness, faintness, sweating, anxiety, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some of these symptoms may be caused by terror rather than venom.

The skin lesions heal spontaneously; but progressive mucosal lesions may not become apparent for months to years. Typically, patients have nasal stuffiness, discharge, and pain. Over time, the infection may progress, resulting in gross mutilation of the nose, palate, oral pharynx, or face. In visceral leishmaniasis, the clinical manifestations usually develop gradually over weeks to months after inoculation of the parasite but can be acute. Irregular fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with a reversed albumin:globulin ratio occur. In some patients, there are twice-daily temperature spikes. Cutaneous skin lesions rarely occur. Emaciation and death occur within months to years in patients with progressive infections. Those with asymptomatic, self-resolving infections and survivors (after successful treatment) are resistant to further attacks unless cell-mediated immunity is impaired (eg, by AIDS). Relapse may occur years after initial infection.  Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may develop after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis in patients in the Sudan and India. It is characterized by flat or nodular cutaneous lesions that contain many parasites. In patients in the Sudan, these lesions develop at the end of or within 6 months of therapy and spontaneously resolve a few months to a year later. In patients in India and adjacent countries, skin lesions typically develop 1 to 2 years after therapy ends and can last for many years. PKDL lesions are thought to be a reservoir for the spread of infection in these areas.  ': 'Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites', '  Lice infestation usually causes severe itching in the infested area. Body lice bites cause small, red, pinpoint holes in the skin. People have scratch marks, hives, or, if intense scratching has broken the skin, a bacterial infection. These symptoms are especially common on the shoulders, buttocks, and abdomen.  Pubic lice bites may also cause bluish gray spots to form on the chest, buttocks, and thighs. Lymph nodes can swell. Lice that have infested the eyelashes cause eye itching, burning, and irritation.    Children may hardly notice head lice or may have only a vague scalp irritation. ': 'Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites', '  The bite of a widow spider usually causes a sharp pain, somewhat like a pinprick, followed by a dull, sometimes numbing, pain in the area around the bite. Cramping pain and muscle stiffness, which may be severe, develop in the abdomen or the shoulders, back, and chest. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, sweating, restlessness, anxiety, headache, drooping and swelling of the eyelids, rash and itching, severe breathing problems, increased saliva production, and weakness.        Did You Know...     Although tarantulas are large and may appear frightening, their bites do not seriously harm people.               The bite of a brown spider may cause little or no immediate pain, but some pain develops in the area around the bite within about an hour. Pain may be severe and may affect the entire injured area, which may become red and bruised and may itch. The rest of the body may itch as well. A blister forms, surrounded by a bruised area or by a more distinct red area that resembles a bullâ\\x80\\x99s-eye. Then the blister enlarges, fills with blood, and ruptures, forming an open sore (ulcer) followed by a thick black scar (eschar) that may leave a large crater-like scar. Uncommonly, nausea and vomiting, aches, fatigue, chills, sweating, blood disorders, and kidney failure develop.

In older children and adults, a rash often occurs (and recurs) in only one or a few spots, especially on the front of the neck, the inner folds of the elbows, and behind the knees. Although the color, intensity, and location of the rash vary, the rash always itches. In older children and adults, intense itching is the main symptom. The itching often leads to uncontrollable scratching, triggering a cycle of itching-scratching-itching that makes the problem worse. Continuous scratching causes the skin to thicken (lichenification).   Itching worsens with dry air, irritation, and emotional stress. Common environmental triggers of symptoms include  Excessive bathing or washing Harsh soaps  Presence of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus on the skin Sweating Rough fabrics and wool    Complications of atopic dermatitis    Scratching and rubbing can also tear the skin, leaving an opening for bacteria to enter and cause infections of the skin, tissues below the skin, and nearby lymph nodes.

': 'Atopic Dermatitis', '     Irritant contact dermatitis    Acute ICD is more painful than pruritic. Signs range from erythema, scaling, and edema to erosions, crusting, and blistering. Chronic and cumulative ICD is more often pruritic.       Allergic contact dermatitis    ACD is more pruritic than painful. Skin changes range from erythema, scaling, and edema, through vesiculation to severe swelling with bullae. Changes often occur in a pattern, distribution, or combination that suggests a specific exposure, such as linear streaking on an arm or leg (eg, due to brushing against poison ivy) or circumferential erythema (under a wristwatch or waistband). Linear streaks are almost always indicative of an external allergen or irritant.  The site of contact is where the allergen contacted the skin, very often the hands, because they touch so many substances. Although the palms and the palmar sides of the fingers are most exposed, ACD often starts in the web spaces between fingers because the thick stratum corneum prevents or delays allergen penetration on the palms and palmar sides of the fingers (also on the soles). With airborne exposure (eg, perfume aerosols), areas not covered by clothing are predominantly affected. Although ACD is typically limited to the site of contact, it may later spread because of scratching and autoeczematization (id reaction, a dermatitis at sites remote from the site of the initial inflammatory problem or infection). Because of the time needed to recruit and expand T cells in the epidermis, ACD typically takes â\\x89¥ 1 day after exposure to become noticeable and takes 2 to 3 days to become further aggravated (crescendo reaction). (In contrast, ICD typically decreases in intensity [decrescendo reaction] after 1 or 2 days.)

Eczema herpeticum is an infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the skin that is more diffuse and widespread than those in nonatopic patients. Eczema herpeticum is commonly the primary HSV infection, but can also result from recurrent infection, in patients with atopic dermatitis. It manifests as grouped vesicles in areas of active or recent dermatitis, although normal skin can be involved. High fever and adenopathy may develop after several days.

The most common symptoms include:': 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is often called the â\\x80\\x9citch that rashes.â\\x80\\x9d This description explains what happens when the condition begins. It tends to start suddenly with very itchy skin. Scratching the itchy skin often causes a rash. A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:Itchy skinDry, scaly areasRed rash (especially on lighter skin tones)Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)Scratch marksRaw skin from scratchingBumps or rashes leaking fluidBlisters that ooze and crust overAfter healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had  atopic dermatitisFlare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:Thickened, scaly, and leatheryCrackedWhen this happens, you may see more lines on your hands, as shown here, or feet.Thickened skin tends to itch most of the time. Treating atopic dermatitis before the skin thickens can help prevent thickened, itchy skin.Where atopic dermatitis develops on the body tends to vary with age. The signs can also differ with race. The following pictures of atopic dermatitis show what you may see.While atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere, babies and young children often develop it on their cheeks, forehead, or scalp. Flare-ups can later also appear on the trunk, legs, or arms. On lighter skin tones, you often see a red rash with bumps (A). Children with darker skin tones may have several bumps with or without redness and darker areas of skin, like on this boyâ\\x80\\x99s forehead (B).Atopic dermatitis is intensely itchy. When babies have itchy skin, they rub against something. The rubbing can cause bumps, which can ooze and then crust over.You may see dry, scaly skin on any area of your babyâ\\x80\\x99s body. If your baby often rubs up against objects to relieve the itch of the dry, scaly skin, your baby may develop raw skin.The discomfort caused by the itch, rash, and dry skin can cause your baby to act fussy or have trouble sleeping. Lack of sleep is common in anyone who has atopic dermatitis, including babies and young children.As children grow and develop, atopic dermatitis often changes. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s what you may see.Between 2 years of age and puberty, the condition often affects these areas of the body. Children with lighter skin tones often develop an itchy rash in the creases of their elbows or backs of their knees. If your child has a darker skin tone, patches tend to form on the fronts of the knees, elbows, and backs of their hands. Other common places for atopic dermatitis to appear are the neck, wrists, and ankles. Children with brown or black skin are more likely than white children to have atopic dermatitis on their trunk.These creases, which are called Dennie-Morgan folds, also develop in people who have asthma or hay fever.Older children and teenagers may have small, itchy bumps on their skin instead of a weepy rash. Scratching can cause the spots to leak fluid and then crust over. On darker skin tones, the bumps tend to be gray to violet-brown in color.Skin that is constantly rubbed or scratched can thicken. This helps protect the skin. Thickened skin is often excessively dry and itches most of the time.Atopic dermatitis usually begins early in life and may go away during childhood or the teen years. Some people continue to have this condition as adults. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also possible for atopic dermatitis to begin when youâ\\x80\\x99re an adult.In adults, atopic dermatitis can take many forms. For some people, the condition looks the same as when they were a child or teenager. Adults may also develop the following:Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis on their hands. In fact, the hands may be the only place adults have the condition.Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis around their eyes. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll often see thickened skin thatâ\\x80\\x99s darker than the surrounding skin.If youâ\\x80\\x99ve had  atopic dermatitis for years, patches of your skin may have permanently thickened and developed a leathery texture, as shown here. This is caused by years of scratching. The affected skin also tends to look darker (or lighter) than the surrounding skin. The thickened skin can itch all the time, even when you donâ\\x80\\x99t have a flare-up.Discolored, extremely dry, and itchy skin: Adults may develop discolored skin thatâ\\x80\\x99s extremely dry and easily irritated. This often develops on the hands or feet, but it can occur anywhere. Some adults have nipple eczema, which can be itchy and painful. The dry, cracked skin and scratching make the skin more susceptible to infection. Infections that people with  atopic dermatitis can develop include: Yellow or golden crusts on the skin, like the ones above this childâ\\x80\\x99s lip, often indicate a staph infection. If you see golden or yellowish crusts, contact your dermatologistâ\\x80\\x99s office.Molluscum contagiosum: Having atopic dermatitis increases the risk of getting this common viral infection, which causes small bumps on the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, dermatologists often recommend treating molluscum, especially if it triggers a flare-up of atopic dermatitis.Eczema herpeticum: This is a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms include dome-shaped blisters and bumps, along with fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In children, babies, and anyone who is immunocompromised, eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care.Many studies find that having atopic dermatitis can cause people to feel anxious, depressed, or both. This is often due to the itch, pain, and problems sleeping. These feelings can also be triggered by flare-ups. Some people say they feel ashamed when others see flare-ups on their skin.When people feel anxious or depressed, they often spend more time alone. This can cause people to feel isolated.While studying atopic dermatitis, researchers have also discovered that some people are more likely than others to develop it. To see if you have an increased risk, go to: ': 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Symptoms of trench foot include a tingling and/or itching sensation, pain, swelling, cold and blotchy skin, numbness, and a prickly or heavy feeling in the foot.

': 'Benign Tumors', \"Scleroderma's signs and symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected.Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of the skin.The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:\\nHeartburn\\nDifficulty swallowing\\nBloating\\nDiarrhea\\nConstipation\\nFecal incontinence\\nWhen scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men. Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma:\\nGenetics. People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. This may explain why a small number of scleroderma cases appear to run in families and why some types of scleroderma are more common for certain ethnic groups.\\nEnvironmental triggers. Research suggests that, in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medications or drugs. Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. An environmental trigger is not identified for most people.\\nImmune system problems. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. People who have scleroderma may also have symptoms of another autoimmune disease â\\x80\\x94 such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome.\\nScleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the:\\nFingertips. In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die.\\nLungs. Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs.\\nKidneys. A serious kidney complication (scleroderma renal crisis) involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function.\\nHeart. Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure. Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart.\\nTeeth. Severe tightening of facial skin can cause your mouth to become smaller and narrower, which may make it hard to brush your teeth or to even have them professionally cleaned. People who have scleroderma often don't produce normal amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more.\\nDigestive system. Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine.\\nJoints.

The nipple can sometimes be ulcerated.The rash is often similar in appearance to other skin conditions, such asÂ\\xa0eczema or psoriasis. If you scratch it, or if it's left untreated, it can bleed, become ulcerated or scab over.If you're experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and is not red or scaly, it's unlikely to be Paget's diseaseÂ\\xa0of the nipple. However, you should still have it checked by a doctor.Around half of all women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple have aÂ\\xa0lump behind the nipple. In 9 out of 10 cases this is an invasive breast cancer.Invasive cancer is where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue.Â\\xa0Some women with Paget's disease have invasive breast cancer but do not have a lump.However, most women with Paget's disease who do not have a lump have non-invasive cancer.This is where the cancerous cells are contained in 1 or more areas of the breast and have not spread.\": 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'The main symptom of ichthyosis is very dry, scaly skin that may also be thick and rough.It usually affects large areas of the body including the arms, legs, torso, ears, face, or the whole body.The symptoms are often there from birth, but they can also appear after a few months or years.

      "Symptoms: Scleroderma's signs and symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected.Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of the skin.The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:\n",
      "Heartburn\n",
      "Difficulty swallowing\n",

      "When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men. Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma:\n",
      "Genetics. People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. This may explain why a small number of scleroderma cases appear to run in families and why some types of scleroderma are more common for certain ethnic groups.\n",
      "Environmental triggers. Research suggests that, in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medications or drugs. Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. An environmental trigger is not identified for most people.\n",
      "Immune system problems. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. People who have scleroderma may also have symptoms of another autoimmune disease â such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome.\n",
      "Scleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the:\n",
      "Fingertips. In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die.\n",
      "Lungs. Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs.\n",
      "Kidneys. A serious kidney complication (scleroderma renal crisis) involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function.\n",
      "Heart. Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure. Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart.\n",
      "Teeth. Severe tightening of facial skin can cause your mouth to become smaller and narrower, which may make it hard to brush your teeth or to even have them professionally cleaned. People who have scleroderma often don't produce normal amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more.\n",
      "Digestive system. Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine.\n",
      "Joints. The skin over joints can become so tight that it restricts joint flexibility and movement, particularly in the hands.\n",

      "Symptoms: Most develop in one of these areas:Ear or earlobeJawlineChestUpper backShoulderBecause a keloid develops after you injure your skin, you can get this scar elsewhere. For example, a woman who has keloid-prone skin can develop a keloid on her belly after having a cesarean section (C-section), hysterectomy, or other surgery in this area.Navel piercing can also cause a keloid on the belly.Men who have darkly pigmented skin and shave their beard area may develop keloids on their face.Itâs rare for a keloid to develop on the genitals, palms, soles, or tongue.Youâll likely notice one or more of the following, as this scar forms:After you injure skin, itâs likely to take 3 to 12 months or longer to see the first signs of a keloid. The first sign is usually thickening skin. About 20% of keloid scars appear more than a year after the injury.When it began, the keloid on this girlâs earlobe looked like a pimple. It continued to grow. Most keloids continue to grow for weeks or months after they appear. A few grow for years. Growth tends to be slow. Occasionally, a keloid grows quickly.While a keloid is growing, it may feel tender or painful. It may itch or cause a burning sensation. Symptoms tend to end when the keloid stops growing, but not always. This man developed keloids on his face after chickenpox cleared. Decades later, the keloids still itch and feel painful.The color of a keloid, like the one on this patientâs shoulder, can differ from that of your natural skin color. When a keloid first appears, itâs often red, pink, or slightly darker than your natural skin tone. As it grows, it may darken. Some become lighter in the center and darker at the edges.Some people say their keloid darkens noticeably after they spent time in the sun. This darkening can be permanent.Once a keloid stops growing, it tends to remain the same size. Unlike other scars, a keloid rarely fades without treatment.The keloid you see on your skin can look different from the keloid you see on someone elseâs skin. Sometimes, one keloid on your skin will look very different from another. The following pictures of keloids show how different keloids can look. Most keloids are either round, oval, or oblong. On the chest, arms, or legs, this scar is usually raised and has a flat surface. A keloid on the ear, neck, or belly may hang from the skin.A keloid can range from the size of a pimple to larger than a football.When you touch a keloid, youâre most likely to feel one of these textures. A few keloids have a texture thatâs somewhere in between hard and soft.Most people develop one or two keloids. Some people get several. Youâre more likely to develop many keloids after acne or chickenpox clears, but not always. The girl in this picture developed two keloids after chickenpox cleared.While most keloids are harmless, they can interfere with your life. A keloid can: When a keloid covers a large area or develops over a joint, the hardened, tight scar tissue often limits how far you can move. If this happens, it may affect your ability to reach, walk, and do other activities.A keloid rarely opens upon its own. Like the rest of your skin, you may see a keloid bleeding if you injure it. An open keloid can become infected. If the wound on a keloid fails to heal, see a dermatologist.Having a keloid can be hard on your self-esteem. These scars can be noticeable. Most people who seek treatment for a keloid do so because they dislike what it looks like.When people see a dermatologist for treatment, they often ask what caused them to get this scar. Youâll find out what causes these scars at Keloid scars: Causes. Images\n",

Skin changes    Systemic sclerosis can damage large areas of skin or only the fingers (sclerodactyly). Sometimes systemic sclerosis tends to stay restricted to the skin of the hands. Other times, the disorder progresses. The skin becomes more widely taut, shiny, and darker than usual. The skin on the face tightens, sometimes resulting in an inability to change facial expressions. However, in some people, the skin can soften over time. Sometimes dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia often referred to as spider veins) can appear on the fingers, chest, face, lips, and tongue, and bumps composed of calcium can develop on the fingers, on other bony areas, or at the joints.

      "Symptoms:   Onset of rheumatoid arthritis is usually insidious, often beginning with systemic and joint symptoms. Systemic symptoms include generalized afternoon fatigue and malaise, anorexia, generalized weakness, and occasionally low-grade fever. Joint symptoms include pain, swelling, and stiffness. Occasionally, the disease begins abruptly, mimicking an acute viral syndrome. The disease progresses most rapidly during the first 6 years, particularly the first year; 80% of patients develop some permanent joint abnormalities within 10 years. The course is unpredictable in individual patients. Joint symptoms are characteristically symmetric. Typically, stiffness lasts > 60 minutes after rising in the morning but may occur after any prolonged inactivity (called gelling). Involved joints become tender, with erythema, warmth, swelling, and limitation of motion. The joints primarily involved include the following:  Wrists and the index (2nd) and middle (3rd) metacarpophalangeal joints (most commonly involved) Proximal interphalangeal joints Metatarsophalangeal joint Shoulders Elbows Hips Knees Ankles However, virtually any joint, except the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, may be involved.

Paradoxically, rheumatoid nodules can increase in patients taking methotrexate, despite lessening of joint inflammation. Visceral nodules (eg, pulmonary) are usually asymptomatic and may occur in severe rheumatoid arthritis. Pulmonary nodules of rheumatoid arthritis cannot be distinguished from pulmonary nodules of other etiology without biopsy.

The same person may also have different symptoms over time.Allergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months or years of exposure. Contact dermatitis often occurs on the hands. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it.Itching is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe. You may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure. The rash may:Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blistersFeel warm and tenderOoze, drain, or crustBecome scaly, raw, or thickened Dermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching. Irritant dermatitis often shows as dry, red, and rough skin. Cuts (fissures) may form on the hands. Skin may become inflamed with long-term exposure.\n",

Polyarthralgia is also prominent. Gastrointestinal disturbances (eg, heartburn, dysphagia) or respiratory complaints (eg, dyspnea) are occasionally the first manifestations.     Skin and nail manifestations    Swelling of the skin is usually symmetric and progresses to induration. It may be confined to the fingers (sclerodactyly) and hands, or it may affect most or all of the body. The skin eventually becomes taut, shiny, and hypopigmented or hyperpigmented; the face becomes masklike; and telangiectases may appear on the fingers, chest, face, lips, and tongue. However, in some patients, skin can soften to variable degrees. Subcutaneous calcifications may develop, usually on the fingertips (pulps) and over bony eminences. Digital ulcers are common, especially on the fingertips, overlying the finger joints, or over calcinotic nodules. Abnormal capillary and microvascular loops in the nails can be seen with an ophthalmoscope or dissecting microscope.

Pericarditis with effusion or pleurisy can occur. Cardiac arrhythmias are common.       Renal manifestations    Severe, often sudden onset renal disease (scleroderma renal crisis) may occur, most commonly in the first 4 to 5 years in patients who usually have diffuse scleroderma and the RNA polymerase III antibody. It is often heralded by sudden, severe hypertension with features of thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. It can also occur without acute hypertension or in systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma, and therefore clinical suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. Corticosteroid use is a risk factor for development of scleroderma renal crisis.   \n",
