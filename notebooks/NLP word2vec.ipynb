      "Symptoms: Most develop in one of these areas:Ear or earlobeJawlineChestUpper backShoulderBecause a keloid develops after you injure your skin, you can get this scar elsewhere. For example, a woman who has keloid-prone skin can develop a keloid on her belly after having a cesarean section (C-section), hysterectomy, or other surgery in this area.Navel piercing can also cause a keloid on the belly.Men who have darkly pigmented skin and shave their beard area may develop keloids on their face.Itâ€™s rare for a keloid to develop on the genitals, palms, soles, or tongue.Youâ€™ll likely notice one or more of the following, as this scar forms:After you injure skin, itâ€™s likely to take 3 to 12 months or longer to see the first signs of a keloid. The first sign is usually thickening skin. About 20% of keloid scars appear more than a year after the injury.When it began, the keloid on this girlâ€™s earlobe looked like a pimple. It continued to grow. Most keloids continue to grow for weeks or months after they appear. A few grow for years. Growth tends to be slow. Occasionally, a keloid grows quickly.While a keloid is growing, it may feel tender or painful. It may itch or cause a burning sensation. Symptoms tend to end when the keloid stops growing, but not always. This man developed keloids on his face after chickenpox cleared. Decades later, the keloids still itch and feel painful.The color of a keloid, like the one on this patientâ€™s shoulder, can differ from that of your natural skin color. When a keloid first appears, itâ€™s often red, pink, or slightly darker than your natural skin tone. As it grows, it may darken. Some become lighter in the center and darker at the edges.Some people say their keloid darkens noticeably after they spent time in the sun. This darkening can be permanent.Once a keloid stops growing, it tends to remain the same size. Unlike other scars, a keloid rarely fades without treatment.The keloid you see on your skin can look different from the keloid you see on someone elseâ€™s skin. Sometimes, one keloid on your skin will look very different from another. The following pictures of keloids show how different keloids can look. Most keloids are either round, oval, or oblong. On the chest, arms, or legs, this scar is usually raised and has a flat surface. A keloid on the ear, neck, or belly may hang from the skin.A keloid can range from the size of a pimple to larger than a football.When you touch a keloid, youâ€™re most likely to feel one of these textures. A few keloids have a texture thatâ€™s somewhere in between hard and soft.Most people develop one or two keloids. Some people get several. Youâ€™re more likely to develop many keloids after acne or chickenpox clears, but not always. The girl in this picture developed two keloids after chickenpox cleared.While most keloids are harmless, they can interfere with your life. A keloid can: When a keloid covers a large area or develops over a joint, the hardened, tight scar tissue often limits how far you can move. If this happens, it may affect your ability to reach, walk, and do other activities.A keloid rarely opens upon its own. Like the rest of your skin, you may see a keloid bleeding if you injure it. An open keloid can become infected. If the wound on a keloid fails to heal, see a dermatologist.Having a keloid can be hard on your self-esteem. These scars can be noticeable. Most people who seek treatment for a keloid do so because they dislike what it looks like.When people see a dermatologist for treatment, they often ask what caused them to get this scar. Youâ€™ll find out what causes these scars at Keloid scars: Causes. Images\n",

Because rosacea is a chronic (long-lasting) skin disease, it can reduce a personâ€™s quality of life. Many people report problems at work, in their marriage, and with meeting new people. Surveys and studies report that living with rosacea can cause:Â Feelings of frustration and embarrassment: In surveys conducted by the National Rosacea Society, 41 percent said their rosacea caused them to avoid public contact or cancel social engagements.Worry: People worry that their rosacea will get worse or cause scars. People worry about side effects from medicine used to treat rosacea.Low self-esteem: Surveys conducted by the National Rosacea Society found that almost 70 percent of people living with rosacea said that the condition lowered their self-confidence and self-esteem.Work-related problems: Surveys conducted by the National Rosacea Society find that when rosacea is severe, 70 percent of people say the disease affects their interactions at work. Nearly 30 percent say that rosacea causes them to miss work.Anxiety and depression: Living with a skin condition that flares unexpectedly can cause people to believe you have a drinking problem. This can cause anxiety and depression.Treatment seems to improve a personâ€™s quality of life. Studies show that when people have fewer signs and symptoms of rosacea, their quality of life improves.Images\n",
