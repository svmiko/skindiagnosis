For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.Talk with a health care provider if you or your child:\\nHas symptoms of atopic dermatitis\\nIs so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities\\nHas a skin infection â\\x80\\x94 look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs\\nHas symptoms even after trying self-care steps\\nSeek immediate medical attention if you or your child has a fever and the rash looks infected.In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors â\\x80\\x94 such as tobacco smoke.In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function.A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms.Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn't contagious.The main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk.Complications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include:\\nAsthma and hay fever. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.\\nFood allergies. People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).\\nChronic itchy, scaly skin. A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.\\nPatches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area. This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.\\nSkin infections. Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.\\nIrritant hand dermatitis. This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.\\nAllergic contact dermatitis. This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.\\nSleep problems. The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.\\nMental health conditions. Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis.\\nDeveloping a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing:\\n\\nMoisturize your skin at least twice a day. Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. Choose a product or products that work well for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented.\\nUsing petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis.\\n\\nTake a daily bath or shower. Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.\\nUse a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean â\\x80\\x94 no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.\\nPat dry. After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).\\nThe triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare.Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include:\\nRough wool fabric\\nDry skin\\nSkin infection\\nHeat and sweat\\nStress\\nCleaning products\\nDust mites and pet dander\\nMold\\nPollen\\nSmoke from tobacco\\nCold and dry air\\nFragrances\\nOther irritating chemicals\\nInfants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow's milk. Talk with your child's health care provider about identifying potential food allergies.Once you understand what triggers your eczema, talk with your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms and prevent flares.\\n\\n\": 'Atopic Dermatitis', \"Contact dermatitis shows up on skin that has been directly exposed to the substance causing the reaction. For example, the rash may show up along a leg that brushed against poison ivy. The rash can develop within minutes to hours of exposure, and it can last 2 to 4 weeks.Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis vary widely and may include:\\nAn itchy rash\\nLeathery patches that are darker than usual (hyperpigmented), typically on brown or Black skin\\nDry, cracked, scaly skin, typically on white skin\\nBumps and blisters, sometimes with oozing and crusting\\nSwelling, burning or tenderness\\nSee your health care provider if:\\nThe rash is so itchy that you can't sleep or go about your day\\nThe rash is severe or widespread\\nYou're worried about how your rash looks\\nThe rash doesn't get better within three weeks\\nThe rash involves the eyes, mouth, face or genitals\\nSeek immediate medical care in the following situations:\\nYou think your skin is infected. Clues include fever and pus oozing from blisters.\\nIt's hard to breathe after inhaling burning weeds.\\nYour eyes or nasal passages hurt after inhaling smoke from burning poison ivy.\\nYou think an ingested substance has damaged the lining of your mouth or digestive tract.\\nContact dermatitis is caused by exposure to a substance that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction. The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants. Often people have irritant and allergic reactions at the same time.Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common type. This nonallergic skin reaction occurs when an irritant damages your skin's outer protective layer.Some people react to strong irritants after a single exposure. Others may develop a rash after repeated exposures to even mild irritants, such as soap and water. And some people develop a tolerance to the substance over time.Common irritants include:\\nSolvents\\nRubber gloves\\nBleach and detergents\\nHair products\\nSoap\\nAirborne substances\\nPlants\\nFertilizers and pesticides\\nAllergic contact dermatitis occurs when a substance to which you're sensitive (allergen) triggers an immune reaction in your skin. It often affects only the area that came into contact with the allergen. But it may be triggered by something that enters your body through foods, flavorings, medicine, or medical or dental procedures (systemic contact dermatitis).People often become sensitized to allergens after many contacts with it over years. Once you develop an allergy to a substance, even a small amount of it can cause a reaction.Common allergens include:\\nNickel, which is used in jewelry, buckles and many other items\\nMedications, such as antibiotic creams\\nBalsam of Peru, which is used in many products, such as perfumes, toothpastes, mouth rinses and flavorings\\nFormaldehyde, which is in preservatives, cosmetics and other products\\nPersonal care products, such as body washes, hair dyes and cosmetics\\nPlants such as poison ivy and mango, which contain a highly allergenic substance called urushiol\\nAirborne allergens, such as ragweed pollen and spray insecticides\\nProducts that cause a reaction when you're in the sun (photoallergic contact dermatitis), such as some sunscreens and cosmetics\\nChildren develop allergic contact dermatitis from the usual offenders and also from exposure to diapers, baby wipes, jewelry used in ear piercing, clothing with snaps or dyes, and so on.The risk of contact dermatitis may be higher in people who have certain jobs and hobbies. Examples include:\\nAgricultural workers\\nCleaners\\nConstruction workers\\nCooks and others who work with food\\nFlorists\\nHair stylists and cosmetologists\\nHealth care workers, including dental workers\\nMachinists\\nMechanics\\nScuba divers or swimmers, due to the rubber in face masks or goggles\\nContact dermatitis can lead to an infection if you repeatedly scratch the affected area, causing it to become wet and oozing. This creates a good place for bacteria or fungi to grow and may cause an infection.You can take the following steps to help prevent contact dermatitis:\\nAvoid irritants and allergens. Try to identify and avoid the cause of your rash. For ear and body piercings, use jewelry made of hypoallergenic material, such as surgical steel or gold.\\nWash your skin. For poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac, you might be able to remove most of the rash-causing substance if you wash your skin right away after coming into contact with it. Use a mild, fragrance-free soap and warm water. Rinse completely. Also wash any clothing or other items that may have come into contact with a plant allergen, such as poison ivy.\\nWear protective clothing or gloves. Face masks, goggles, gloves and other protective items can shield you from irritating substances, including household cleansers.\\nApply an iron-on patch to cover metal fasteners next to your skin. This can help you avoid a reaction to jean snaps, for example.\\nApply a barrier cream or gel. These products can provide a protective layer for your skin. For example, a nonprescription skin cream containing bentoquatam (Ivy Block) may prevent or lessen your skin's reaction to poison ivy.\\nUse moisturizer. Regularly applying moisturizing lotions can help restore your skin's outermost layer and keep your skin supple.\\nTake care around pets. Allergens from plants, such as poison ivy, can cling to pets and then be spread to people. Bathe your pet if you think it got into poison ivy or something similar.\\n\\n\\n\": 'Atopic Dermatitis', \"Paget's disease of the breast affects your nipple and usually the skin (areola) surrounding it.

Or use fragrance-free moisturizing soap with no alcohol or allergy-causing substances (hypoallergenic soap), especially if you handwash often. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Apply a moisturizing cream while your skin is still damp.\\nShave with care. Shaving can be drying. If you shave, use a lubricating agent before you start. Shave in the direction of hair growth, unless that irritates your skin. Use a sharp blade and rinse it with warm water after each stroke. When done, apply moisturizer.\\nCover as much skin as possible in cold or windy weather. Harsh weather can be especially drying to skin.

In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:\\nHeartburn\\nDifficulty swallowing\\nBloating\\nDiarrhea\\nConstipation\\nFecal incontinence\\nWhen scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men. Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma:\\nGenetics. People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. This may explain why a small number of scleroderma cases appear to run in families and why some types of scleroderma are more common for certain ethnic groups.\\nEnvironmental triggers. Research suggests that, in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medications or drugs. Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. An environmental trigger is not identified for most people.\\nImmune system problems. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. People who have scleroderma may also have symptoms of another autoimmune disease â\\x80\\x94 such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome.\\nScleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the:\\nFingertips. In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die.\\nLungs. Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs.\\nKidneys. A serious kidney complication (scleroderma renal crisis) involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function.\\nHeart. Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure. Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart.\\nTeeth. Severe tightening of facial skin can cause your mouth to become smaller and narrower, which may make it hard to brush your teeth or to even have them professionally cleaned. People who have scleroderma often don't produce normal amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more.\\nDigestive system. Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine.\\nJoints. The skin over joints can become so tight that it restricts joint flexibility and movement, particularly in the hands.\\n\\n\\n\": 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Actinic keratoses vary in appearance.

Common reported triggers for these flares include sun exposure, emotional stress, cold or hot weather, alcohol, spicy foods, exercise, wind, cosmetics, and hot baths or hot drinks. These symptoms persist throughout other phases of the disorder. In the vascular phase, patients develop facial erythema and edema with multiple telangiectases, possibly as a result of persistent vasomotor instability.   An inflammatory phase often follows, in which sterile papules and pustules (leading to the designation of rosacea as adult acne) develop.   The late phase (developing in some patients), is characterized by coarse tissue hyperplasia of the cheeks and nose (rhinophyma) caused by tissue inflammation, collagen deposition, and sebaceous gland hyperplasia.   The phases of rosacea are usually sequential. Some patients go directly into the inflammatory stage, bypassing the earlier stages. Treatment may cause rosacea to return to an earlier stage. Progression to the late stage is not inevitable. Ocular rosacea often precedes or accompanies facial rosacea and manifests as some combination of blepharoconjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis, and keratitis, causing itching, foreign body sensation, erythema, and edema of the eye.

Multiple lesions may occur after multiple infective bites or with metastatic spread. Their appearance varies. The initial lesion is often a papule that slowly enlarges, ulcerates centrally, and develops a raised, erythematous border where intracellular parasites are concentrated. Ulcers are typically painless and cause no systemic symptoms unless secondarily infected. Lesions heal spontaneously after several months but may persist for years. They leave a depressed, burn-like scar. The course depends on the infecting Leishmania species and the hostâ\\x80\\x99s immune status.

Mucosal leishmaniasis due to L. braziliensis and related organisms typically starts with one or more primary cutaneous ulcers. Spread to the mucosa via lymphatics and the bloodstream probably occurs early in infection. The skin lesions heal spontaneously; but progressive mucosal lesions may not become apparent for months to years. Typically, patients have nasal stuffiness, discharge, and pain. Over time, the infection may progress, resulting in gross mutilation of the nose, palate, oral pharynx, or face. In visceral leishmaniasis, the clinical manifestations usually develop gradually over weeks to months after inoculation of the parasite but can be acute. Irregular fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with a reversed albumin:globulin ratio occur. In some patients, there are twice-daily temperature spikes. Cutaneous skin lesions rarely occur. Emaciation and death occur within months to years in patients with progressive infections. Those with asymptomatic, self-resolving infections and survivors (after successful treatment) are resistant to further attacks unless cell-mediated immunity is impaired (eg, by AIDS). Relapse may occur years after initial infection.  Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may develop after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis in patients in the Sudan and India. It is characterized by flat or nodular cutaneous lesions that contain many parasites. In patients in the Sudan, these lesions develop at the end of or within 6 months of therapy and spontaneously resolve a few months to a year later. In patients in India and adjacent countries, skin lesions typically develop 1 to 2 years after therapy ends and can last for many years. PKDL lesions are thought to be a reservoir for the spread of infection in these areas.

The itching often leads to uncontrollable scratching, triggering a cycle of itching-scratching-itching that makes the problem worse. Continuous scratching causes the skin to thicken (lichenification).   Itching worsens with dry air, irritation, and emotional stress. Common environmental triggers of symptoms include  Excessive bathing or washing Harsh soaps  Presence of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus on the skin Sweating Rough fabrics and wool    Complications of atopic dermatitis    Scratching and rubbing can also tear the skin, leaving an opening for bacteria to enter and cause infections of the skin, tissues below the skin, and nearby lymph nodes.

These contact reactions are triggered when the skin comes in to contact with an allergen, which is a substance that sensitizes the skin.

': 'Atopic Dermatitis', '     Irritant contact dermatitis    Acute ICD is more painful than pruritic. Signs range from erythema, scaling, and edema to erosions, crusting, and blistering. Chronic and cumulative ICD is more often pruritic.       Allergic contact dermatitis    ACD is more pruritic than painful. Skin changes range from erythema, scaling, and edema, through vesiculation to severe swelling with bullae. Changes often occur in a pattern, distribution, or combination that suggests a specific exposure, such as linear streaking on an arm or leg (eg, due to brushing against poison ivy) or circumferential erythema (under a wristwatch or waistband). Linear streaks are almost always indicative of an external allergen or irritant.  The site of contact is where the allergen contacted the skin, very often the hands, because they touch so many substances. Although the palms and the palmar sides of the fingers are most exposed, ACD often starts in the web spaces between fingers because the thick stratum corneum prevents or delays allergen penetration on the palms and palmar sides of the fingers (also on the soles). With airborne exposure (eg, perfume aerosols), areas not covered by clothing are predominantly affected. Although ACD is typically limited to the site of contact, it may later spread because of scratching and autoeczematization (id reaction, a dermatitis at sites remote from the site of the initial inflammatory problem or infection). Because of the time needed to recruit and expand T cells in the epidermis, ACD typically takes â\\x89¥ 1 day after exposure to become noticeable and takes 2 to 3 days to become further aggravated (crescendo reaction). (In contrast, ICD typically decreases in intensity [decrescendo reaction] after 1 or 2 days.)

Eczema herpeticum is an infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the skin that is more diffuse and widespread than those in nonatopic patients. Eczema herpeticum is commonly the primary HSV infection, but can also result from recurrent infection, in patients with atopic dermatitis. It manifests as grouped vesicles in areas of active or recent dermatitis, although normal skin can be involved. High fever and adenopathy may develop after several days. Occasionally, this infection can become systemic, which may be fatal. Sometimes the eye is involved, causing a painful corneal lesion.

It tends to start suddenly with very itchy skin. Scratching the itchy skin often causes a rash. A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:Itchy skinDry, scaly areasRed rash (especially on lighter skin tones)Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)Scratch marksRaw skin from scratchingBumps or rashes leaking fluidBlisters that ooze and crust overAfter healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had  atopic dermatitisFlare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:Thickened, scaly, and leatheryCrackedWhen this happens, you may see more lines on your hands, as shown here, or feet.Thickened skin tends to itch most of the time. Treating atopic dermatitis before the skin thickens can help prevent thickened, itchy skin.Where atopic dermatitis develops on the body tends to vary with age. The signs can also differ with race. The following pictures of atopic dermatitis show what you may see.While atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere, babies and young children often develop it on their cheeks, forehead, or scalp. Flare-ups can later also appear on the trunk, legs, or arms. On lighter skin tones, you often see a red rash with bumps (A). Children with darker skin tones may have several bumps with or without redness and darker areas of skin, like on this boyâ\\x80\\x99s forehead (B).Atopic dermatitis is intensely itchy. When babies have itchy skin, they rub against something. The rubbing can cause bumps, which can ooze and then crust over.You may see dry, scaly skin on any area of your babyâ\\x80\\x99s body. If your baby often rubs up against objects to relieve the itch of the dry, scaly skin, your baby may develop raw skin.The discomfort caused by the itch, rash, and dry skin can cause your baby to act fussy or have trouble sleeping. Lack of sleep is common in anyone who has atopic dermatitis, including babies and young children.As children grow and develop, atopic dermatitis often changes. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s what you may see.Between 2 years of age and puberty, the condition often affects these areas of the body. Children with lighter skin tones often develop an itchy rash in the creases of their elbows or backs of their knees. If your child has a darker skin tone, patches tend to form on the fronts of the knees, elbows, and backs of their hands. Other common places for atopic dermatitis to appear are the neck, wrists, and ankles. Children with brown or black skin are more likely than white children to have atopic dermatitis on their trunk.These creases, which are called Dennie-Morgan folds, also develop in people who have asthma or hay fever.Older children and teenagers may have small, itchy bumps on their skin instead of a weepy rash. Scratching can cause the spots to leak fluid and then crust over. On darker skin tones, the bumps tend to be gray to violet-brown in color.Skin that is constantly rubbed or scratched can thicken. This helps protect the skin. Thickened skin is often excessively dry and itches most of the time.Atopic dermatitis usually begins early in life and may go away during childhood or the teen years. Some people continue to have this condition as adults. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also possible for atopic dermatitis to begin when youâ\\x80\\x99re an adult.In adults, atopic dermatitis can take many forms. For some people, the condition looks the same as when they were a child or teenager. Adults may also develop the following:Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis on their hands. In fact, the hands may be the only place adults have the condition.Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis around their eyes. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll often see thickened skin thatâ\\x80\\x99s darker than the surrounding skin.If youâ\\x80\\x99ve had  atopic dermatitis for years, patches of your skin may have permanently thickened and developed a leathery texture, as shown here. This is caused by years of scratching. The affected skin also tends to look darker (or lighter) than the surrounding skin. The thickened skin can itch all the time, even when you donâ\\x80\\x99t have a flare-up.Discolored, extremely dry, and itchy skin: Adults may develop discolored skin thatâ\\x80\\x99s extremely dry and easily irritated. This often develops on the hands or feet, but it can occur anywhere. Some adults have nipple eczema, which can be itchy and painful. The dry, cracked skin and scratching make the skin more susceptible to infection. Infections that people with  atopic dermatitis can develop include: Yellow or golden crusts on the skin, like the ones above this childâ\\x80\\x99s lip, often indicate a staph infection. If you see golden or yellowish crusts, contact your dermatologistâ\\x80\\x99s office.Molluscum contagiosum: Having atopic dermatitis increases the risk of getting this common viral infection, which causes small bumps on the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, dermatologists often recommend treating molluscum, especially if it triggers a flare-up of atopic dermatitis.Eczema herpeticum: This is a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms include dome-shaped blisters and bumps, along with fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In children, babies, and anyone who is immunocompromised, eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care.Many studies find that having atopic dermatitis can cause people to feel anxious, depressed, or both. This is often due to the itch, pain, and problems sleeping. These feelings can also be triggered by flare-ups.

      "Symptoms:   Atopic dermatitis usually begins in infancy, as early as 3 months of age.  In the early (acute) phase, red, oozing, and crusted areas develop, and sometimes blisters. Itching is often intense.  In the chronic (later) phase, scratching and rubbing create areas that appear dry and thickened (lichenified).     Examples of Atopic Dermatitis             Atopic Dermatitis (Acute)  Atopic dermatitis usually develops in infancy. In the early (acute) phase, the rash appears on the face and then spreads to the neck, scalp, arms, and legs.  Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD.      Atopic Dermatitis (Chronic)  In the chronic (later) phase of atopic dermatitis, the rash often occurs in only one or a few spots, such as on the inner fold of the elbow area seen here.  Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD.      Atopic Dermatitis (Back of Knees)  This photo shows red crusted spots on the back of the knees and legs.  Â© Springer Science+Business Media                      In infants, rashes on the face spread to the neck, eyelids, scalp, hands, arms, feet, and legs. Large areas of the body may be affected.  In older children and adults, a rash often occurs (and recurs) in only one or a few spots, especially on the front of the neck, the inner folds of the elbows, and behind the knees. Although the color, intensity, and location of the rash vary, the rash always itches. In older children and adults, intense itching is the main symptom. The itching often leads to uncontrollable scratching, triggering a cycle of itching-scratching-itching that makes the problem worse. Continuous scratching causes the skin to thicken (lichenification).   Itching worsens with dry air, irritation, and emotional stress. Common environmental triggers of symptoms include  Excessive bathing or washing Harsh soaps  Presence of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus on the skin Sweating Rough fabrics and wool    Complications of atopic dermatitis    Scratching and rubbing can also tear the skin, leaving an opening for bacteria to enter and cause infections of the skin, tissues below the skin, and nearby lymph nodes. Widespread inflammation and scaling of the skin also can develop. In people with atopic dermatitis, infection with the herpes simplex virus     Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections  Herpes simplex virus infection causes recurring episodes of small, painful, fluid-filled blisters on the skin, mouth, lips (cold sores), eyes, or genitals.

These contact reactions are triggered when the skin comes in to contact with an allergen, which is a substance that sensitizes the skin.
