Batches of welts (wheals) that can arise anywhere on the body
Welts that might be red, purple or skin-colored, depending on your skin color
Welts that vary in size, change shape, and appear and fade repeatedly
Itchiness (pruritus), which can be intense
Painful swelling (angioedema) around the eyes, cheeks or lips
Flares triggered by heat, exercise or stress
Symptoms that persist for more than six weeks and recur often and anytime, sometimes for months or years
See your health care provider if you have severe hives or hives that last for more than a few days.Chronic hives do not put you at sudden risk of a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). If you get hives as part of a severe allergic reaction, seek emergency care. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include dizziness, trouble breathing, and swelling of the tongue, lips, mouth or throat.The welts that come with hives are caused by the release of immune system chemicals, such as histamine, into your bloodstream. It's often not known why chronic hives happen or why short-term hives sometimes turn into a long-term problem.The skin reaction may be triggered by:
Heat or cold
Sunlight
Vibration, such as caused by jogging or using lawnmowers
Pressure on the skin, as from a tight waistband
Medical conditions, such as thyroid disease, infection, allergy and cancer
Chronic hives don't put you at sudden risk of a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). If you do get hives as part of a severe allergic reaction, seek emergency care. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include dizziness, trouble breathing, and swelling of the tongue, lips, mouth or throat. To lower your likelihood of experiencing hives or angioedema, take the following precautions:
Avoid known triggers. If you know what has triggered your hives, try to avoid that substance.
Bathe and change your clothes. If pollen or animal contact has triggered your hives in the past, take a bath or shower and change your clothes if you're exposed to pollen or animals.
