445,Atopic Dermatitis,"Symptoms of keratosis pilaris may include:You usually get patches of small bumps on your arms, thighs or bottom, but they can appear in other places.The bumps are usually the colour of your skin. They can also be red on white skin or brownish-black on darker skin.The skin can sometimes feel itchy, and may be better in summer and worse in winter."
44,Atopic Dermatitis,"Keratosis pilaris can occur at any age, but it's more common in young children. Symptoms include:
Painless tiny bumps on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks
Dry, rough skin in the areas with bumps
Worsening when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin
Sandpaper-like bumps resembling goose flesh
Treatment for keratosis pilaris usually isn't needed. But if you're concerned about your or your child's skin, consult your health care provider or a specialist in skin conditions (dermatologist).Keratosis pilaris is caused by the buildup of keratin â a hard protein that protects skin from harmful substances and infection. The keratin blocks the opening of hair follicles, causing patches of rough, bumpy skin.It's not clear why keratin builds up in people with keratosis pilaris. It might happen along with a genetic disease or skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. Dry skin tends to make keratosis pilaris worse.

"
45,Atopic Dermatitis,"Actinic keratoses vary in appearance. Symptoms include:
Rough, dry or scaly patch of skin, usually less than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter
Flat to slightly raised patch or bump on the top layer of skin
In some cases, a hard, wartlike surface
Color variations, including pink, red or brown
Itching, burning, bleeding or crusting
New patches or bumps on sun-exposed areas of the head, neck, hands and forearms
"
404,Atopic Dermatitis,"Symptoms of seborrheic keratosis are skin growths that:Are located on the face, chest, shoulders, back, or other areas, except the lips, palms, and solesAre painless, but may become irritated and itchyAre most often tan, brown, or blackHave a slightly raised, flat surfaceMay have a rough texture (like a wart)Often have a waxy surfaceAre round or ovalMay look like a piece of bee's wax that has been ""pasted-on"" the skinOften appear in clusters "
403,Atopic Dermatitis,"Symptoms may include:Small bumps that look like ""goose bumps"" on the back of the upper arms and thighsBumps feel like very rough sandpaperSkin-colored bumps are the size of a grain of sandSlight pinkness may be seen around some bumpsBumps may appear on the face and be mistaken for acne "
28,Atopic Dermatitis,"Eyelid dermatitis develops when the folds of skin above and below your eyes come into contact with an allergen or irritant. Itâs a form of contact dermatitis. The symptoms are annoying, but shouldnât interfere with your daily life."
27,Atopic Dermatitis,"Paget's disease of the breast affects your nipple and usually the skin (areola) surrounding it. It's easy to mistake the signs and symptoms of Paget's disease of the breast for skin irritation (dermatitis) or another noncancerous (benign) skin condition.Possible signs and symptoms of Paget's disease of the breast include:
Flaky or scaly skin on your nipple
Crusty, oozing or hardened skin resembling eczema on the nipple, areola or both
Itching
Redness
A tingling or burning sensation
Straw-colored or bloody nipple discharge
A flattened or turned-in (inverted) nipple
A lump in the breast
Thickening skin on the breast
"
26,Atopic Dermatitis,"Contact dermatitis shows up on skin that has been directly exposed to the substance causing the reaction. For example, the rash may show up along a leg that brushed against poison ivy. The rash can develop within minutes to hours of exposure, and it can last 2 to 4 weeks.Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis vary widely and may include:
An itchy rash
Leathery patches that are darker than usual (hyperpigmented), typically on brown or Black skin
Dry, cracked, scaly skin, typically on white skin
Bumps and blisters, sometimes with oozing and crusting
Swelling, burning or tenderness
See your health care provider if:
The rash is so itchy that you can't sleep or go about your day
The rash is severe or widespread
You're worried about how your rash looks
The rash doesn't get better within three weeks
The rash involves the eyes, mouth, face or genitals
Seek immediate medical care in the following situations:
You think your skin is infected. Clues include fever and pus oozing from blisters.
It's hard to breathe after inhaling burning weeds.
Your eyes or nasal passages hurt after inhaling smoke from burning poison ivy.
You think an ingested substance has damaged the lining of your mouth or digestive tract.
Contact dermatitis is caused by exposure to a substance that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction. The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants. Often people have irritant and allergic reactions at the same time.Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common type. This nonallergic skin reaction occurs when an irritant damages your skin's outer protective layer.Some people react to strong irritants after a single exposure. Others may develop a rash after repeated exposures to even mild irritants, such as soap and water. And some people develop a tolerance to the substance over time.Common irritants include:
Solvents
Rubber gloves
Bleach and detergents
Hair products
Soap
Airborne substances
Plants
Fertilizers and pesticides
Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when a substance to which you're sensitive (allergen) triggers an immune reaction in your skin. It often affects only the area that came into contact with the allergen. But it may be triggered by something that enters your body through foods, flavorings, medicine, or medical or dental procedures (systemic contact dermatitis).People often become sensitized to allergens after many contacts with it over years. Once you develop an allergy to a substance, even a small amount of it can cause a reaction.Common allergens include:
Nickel, which is used in jewelry, buckles and many other items
Medications, such as antibiotic creams
Balsam of Peru, which is used in many products, such as perfumes, toothpastes, mouth rinses and flavorings
Formaldehyde, which is in preservatives, cosmetics and other products
Personal care products, such as body washes, hair dyes and cosmetics
Plants such as poison ivy and mango, which contain a highly allergenic substance called urushiol
Airborne allergens, such as ragweed pollen and spray insecticides
Products that cause a reaction when you're in the sun (photoallergic contact dermatitis), such as some sunscreens and cosmetics
Children develop allergic contact dermatitis from the usual offenders and also from exposure to diapers, baby wipes, jewelry used in ear piercing, clothing with snaps or dyes, and so on.The risk of contact dermatitis may be higher in people who have certain jobs and hobbies. Examples include:
Agricultural workers
Cleaners
Construction workers
Cooks and others who work with food
Florists
Hair stylists and cosmetologists
Health care workers, including dental workers
Machinists
Mechanics
Scuba divers or swimmers, due to the rubber in face masks or goggles
Contact dermatitis can lead to an infection if you repeatedly scratch the affected area, causing it to become wet and oozing. This creates a good place for bacteria or fungi to grow and may cause an infection.You can take the following steps to help prevent contact dermatitis:
Avoid irritants and allergens. Try to identify and avoid the cause of your rash. For ear and body piercings, use jewelry made of hypoallergenic material, such as surgical steel or gold.
Wash your skin. For poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac, you might be able to remove most of the rash-causing substance if you wash your skin right away after coming into contact with it. Use a mild, fragrance-free soap and warm water. Rinse completely. Also wash any clothing or other items that may have come into contact with a plant allergen, such as poison ivy.
Wear protective clothing or gloves. Face masks, goggles, gloves and other protective items can shield you from irritating substances, including household cleansers.
Apply an iron-on patch to cover metal fasteners next to your skin. This can help you avoid a reaction to jean snaps, for example.
Apply a barrier cream or gel. These products can provide a protective layer for your skin. For example, a nonprescription skin cream containing bentoquatam (Ivy Block) may prevent or lessen your skin's reaction to poison ivy.
Use moisturizer. Regularly applying moisturizing lotions can help restore your skin's outermost layer and keep your skin supple.
Take care around pets. Allergens from plants, such as poison ivy, can cling to pets and then be spread to people. Bathe your pet if you think it got into poison ivy or something similar.

87,Atopic Dermatitis,"Hypopigmentation is a lightening of your skin color. Injuries or skin conditions are the primary cause of hypopigmentation. Treatment depends on what caused hypopigmentation, but it may involve medications or therapies. If you have scars or albinism, thereâs no treatment available."
25,Atopic Dermatitis,"Atopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. They may include:
Dry, cracked skin
Itchiness (pruritus)
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin
Oozing and crusting
Thickened skin
Darkening of the skin around the eyes
Raw, sensitive skin from scratching
Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years. For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.Talk with a health care provider if you or your child:
Has symptoms of atopic dermatitis
Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities
Has a skin infection â look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs
Has symptoms even after trying self-care steps
Seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has a fever and the rash looks infected.In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors â such as tobacco smoke.In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function.A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms.Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn't contagious.The main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk.Complications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include:
Asthma and hay fever. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.
Food allergies. People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).
Chronic itchy, scaly skin. A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.
Patches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area. This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.
Skin infections. Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.
Irritant hand dermatitis. This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.
Allergic contact dermatitis. This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.
Sleep problems. The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.
Mental health conditions. Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis.
Developing a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing:

Moisturize your skin at least twice a day. Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. Choose a product or products that work well for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented.
Using petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis.

Take a daily bath or shower. Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.
Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean â no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.
Pat dry. After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).
The triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare.Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include:
Rough wool fabric
Dry skin
Skin infection
Heat and sweat
Stress
Cleaning products
Dust mites and pet dander
Mold
Pollen
Smoke from tobacco
Cold and dry air
Fragrances
Other irritating chemicals
Infants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow's milk. Talk with your child's health care provider about identifying potential food allergies.Once you understand what triggers your eczema, talk with your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms and prevent flares.

33,Atopic Dermatitis,"Atopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. They may include:
Dry, cracked skin
Itchiness (pruritus)
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin
Oozing and crusting
Thickened skin
Darkening of the skin around the eyes
Raw, sensitive skin from scratching
Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years. For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.Talk with a health care provider if you or your child:
Has symptoms of atopic dermatitis
Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities
Has a skin infection â look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs
Has symptoms even after trying self-care steps
Seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has a fever and the rash looks infected.In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors â such as tobacco smoke.In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function.A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms.Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn't contagious.The main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk.Complications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include:
Asthma and hay fever. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.
Food allergies. People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).
Chronic itchy, scaly skin. A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.
Patches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area. This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.
Skin infections. Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.
Irritant hand dermatitis. This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.
Allergic contact dermatitis. This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.
Sleep problems. The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.
Mental health conditions. Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis.
Developing a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing:

Moisturize your skin at least twice a day. Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. Choose a product or products that work well for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented.
Using petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis.

Take a daily bath or shower. Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.
Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean â no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.
Pat dry. After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).
The triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare.Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include:
Rough wool fabric
Dry skin
Skin infection
Heat and sweat
Stress
Cleaning products
Dust mites and pet dander
Mold
Pollen
Smoke from tobacco
Cold and dry air
Fragrances
Other irritating chemicals
Infants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow's milk.

37,Atopic Dermatitis,"Dry skin is often temporary or seasonal â you might get it only in winter, for example â or you might need to treat it long term. Signs and symptoms of dry skin might vary based on your age, health status, skin tone, living environment and sun exposure. They include:
A feeling of skin tightness
Skin that feels and looks rough
Itchiness (pruritus)
Slight to severe flaking skin, which causes the ashy look that can affect dry brown and black skin
Slight to severe scaling or peeling
Cracked ""dry riverbed"" look to leg
Fine lines or cracks
Skin that ranges from reddish on white skin to grayish on brown and black skin
Deep cracks that may bleed
Most cases of dry skin respond well to lifestyle changes and home remedies. You may need help from your primary care doctor or a doctor who specializes in skin conditions (dermatologist) if:
You've tried self-care steps but your signs and symptoms persist
Your skin becomes inflamed or painful
You develop dry, thick skin as a side effect of cancer treatment
Your condition makes you so uncomfortable that you're losing sleep or are distracted from your daily routines
You have open sores or infections from scratching
You have large areas of scaly or peeling skin
Dry skin is due to water loss from the outer layer of skin. It might be caused by:
Heat. Central heating, wood-burning stoves, space heaters and fireplaces all reduce humidity.
Environment. Living in cold, windy conditions or low-humidity climates.
Too much bathing or scrubbing. Taking long, hot showers or baths or scrubbing your skin too much can dry your skin. Bathing more than once a day can remove the natural oils from your skin too.
Harsh soaps and detergents. Many popular soaps, detergents and shampoos strip moisture from your skin because they are formulated to remove oil.
Other skin conditions. People with skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) or psoriasis are more likely to have dry skin.
Medical treatments. Some people develop dry, thick skin after undergoing treatment for cancer, receiving dialysis or taking certain medications.
Aging. As people age, the skin thins and produces less of the oils needed for the skin to retain water.
Anyone can develop dry skin. But you're more likely to develop the condition if you:
Are over 40, as the skin's ability to retain moisture diminishes with age
Live in cold, windy conditions or low-humidity climates
Have a job that requires you to immerse your hands in water, such as nursing or hairstyling
Use your hands to work with cement, clay or soil
Swim frequently in chlorinated pools
Have certain diseases or conditions, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes or malnutrition
Dry skin is usually harmless. But when it's not cared for, dry skin may lead to:
Atopic dermatitis (eczema). If you're prone to develop this condition, excessive dryness can lead to activation of the disease, causing a rash and cracking skin.
Infections. Dry skin may crack, allowing bacteria to enter, causing infections.
These complications are most likely to occur when your skin's protective mechanisms are severely compromised. For example, severely dry skin can cause deep cracks or fissures, which can open and bleed, providing an avenue for invading bacteria.Try these tips to help your skin retain moisture:
Moisturize. Moisturizer seals in water to help keep your skin's protective barrier healthy. Use moisturizer throughout the day, especially on the hands. And before going outdoors, use a moisturizer that contains sunblock or a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously and reapply every two hours â or more often if you're swimming or sweating.
Limit water exposure. Keep bath and shower time to 10 minutes or less. Use warm, not hot, water. Rinse and pat dry. Try to bathe no more than once a day.
Use a gentle cleanser or allergen-free soap. Try a nonsoap cleansing cream or shower gel. Or use fragrance-free moisturizing soap with no alcohol or allergy-causing substances (hypoallergenic soap), especially if you handwash often. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Apply a moisturizing cream while your skin is still damp.
Shave with care. Shaving can be drying. If you shave, use a lubricating agent before you start. Shave in the direction of hair growth, unless that irritates your skin. Use a sharp blade and rinse it with warm water after each stroke. When done, apply moisturizer.
Cover as much skin as possible in cold or windy weather. Harsh weather can be especially drying to skin. Scarves, hats, and gloves or mittens help protect your skin when you're outdoors.
Wear gloves. Protect your hands with suitable gloves when gardening, using harsh cleansers and doing other skin-drying activities.
Rinse and moisturize after swimming. This is especially important if you've been swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool.
Drink when you're thirsty. Drink noncaffeinated beverages each day to help keep all your body's tissues, including your skin, well hydrated.
Bathe babies with care. For babies, using a cleanser every 1-2 weeks for bathing usually is enough. Otherwise, bathe them in just water. However, clean their diaper area with each diaper change. Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly (Vaseline, Aquaphor, others) while the skin is still damp.


"
38,Atopic Dermatitis,"Keratosis pilaris can occur at any age, but it's more common in young children. Symptoms include:
Painless tiny bumps on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks
Dry, rough skin in the areas with bumps
Worsening when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin
Sandpaper-like bumps resembling goose flesh
Treatment for keratosis pilaris usually isn't needed. But if you're concerned about your or your child's skin, consult your health care provider or a specialist in skin conditions (dermatologist).Keratosis pilaris is caused by the buildup of keratin â a hard protein that protects skin from harmful substances and infection. The keratin blocks the opening of hair follicles, causing patches of rough, bumpy skin.It's not clear why keratin builds up in people with keratosis pilaris. It might happen along with a genetic disease or skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. Dry skin tends to make keratosis pilaris worse.

402,Atopic Dermatitis,"Affected babies may have very red skin (erythroderma) and severe blisters. As affected individuals get older, blistering is less frequent, erythroderma becomes less evident, and the skin becomes thick (hyperkeratotic), especially over joints, on areas of skin that come into contact with each other, or on the scalp or neck. This thickened skin is usually darker than normal. Bacteria can grow in the thick skin, often causing a distinct odor."
434,Atopic Dermatitis,"Atopic eczemaÂ causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore.Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body.Inflamed skin can look red on white skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on brown and black skin.

203,Atopic Dermatitis,"Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is often called the itch that rashes. This description explains what happens when the condition begins. It tends to start suddenly with very itchy skin. Scratching the itchy skin often causes a rash.

A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.

Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:

Itchy skin

Dry, scaly areas

Red rash (especially on lighter skin tones)

Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)

Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)

Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)

Scratch marks

Raw skin from scratching

Bumps or rashes leaking fluid

Blisters that ooze and crust over

After healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had atopic dermatitis

Flare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.

Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.

Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:

Thickened, scaly, and leathery

Cracked"

They usually appear on the face, upper arms, neck, and upper middle of the body. After these lesions go away, the patches turn light-colored (hypopigmented).The patches do not tan easily. Because of this, they may get red quickly in the sun. As the skin surrounding the patches darkens normally, the patches may become more visible."
43,Atopic Dermatitis,"Keratosis pilaris can occur at any age, but it's more common in young children. Symptoms include:
Painless tiny bumps on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks
Dry, rough skin in the areas with bumps
Worsening when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin
Sandpaper-like bumps resembling goose flesh
Treatment for keratosis pilaris usually isn't needed. But if you're concerned about your or your child's skin, consult your health care provider or a specialist in skin conditions (dermatologist).Keratosis pilaris is caused by the buildup of keratin â a hard protein that protects skin from harmful substances and infection. The keratin blocks the opening of hair follicles, causing patches of rough, bumpy skin.It's not clear why keratin builds up in people with keratosis pilaris. It might happen along with a genetic disease or skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. Dry skin tends to make keratosis pilaris worse.

41,Atopic Dermatitis,"Scleroderma's signs and symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected.Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of the skin.The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:
Heartburn
Difficulty swallowing
Bloating
Diarrhea
Constipation
Fecal incontinence
When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men. Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma:
Genetics. People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. This may explain why a small number of scleroderma cases appear to run in families and why some types of scleroderma are more common for certain ethnic groups.
Environmental triggers. Research suggests that, in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medications or drugs. Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. An environmental trigger is not identified for most people.
Immune system problems. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. People who have scleroderma may also have symptoms of another autoimmune disease â such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome.
Scleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the:
Fingertips. In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die.
Lungs. Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs.
Kidneys. A serious kidney complication (scleroderma renal crisis) involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function.
Heart. Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure. Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart.
Teeth. Severe tightening of facial skin can cause your mouth to become smaller and narrower, which may make it hard to brush your teeth or to even have them professionally cleaned. People who have scleroderma often don't produce normal amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more.
Digestive system. Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine.
Joints. The skin over joints can become so tight that it restricts joint flexibility and movement, particularly in the hands.

293,Atopic Dermatitis,The symptoms of ichthyosis can range from mild to severe. The most common symptoms include:
328,Atopic Dermatitis,"Actinic keratosis (AK) is a skin disorder that causes rough, scaly patches of skin. Another name for AK is solar keratosis. AK is a type of precancer, which means that if you donât treat the condition, it could turn into cancer. Without treatment, AK can lead to a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma."
290,Atopic Dermatitis,"Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a condition that causes an itchy rash to develop on your skin. The rash can appear anywhere on your body. Eczema can develop on your nipples as well as your areola (the dark circle of skin surrounding the nipples). This condition affects babies, children and adults of all genders."
326,Atopic Dermatitis,"Keratosis pilaris can occur at any age, but it's more common in young children. Symptoms include:
Painless tiny bumps on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks
Dry, rough skin in the areas with bumps
Worsening when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin
Sandpaper-like bumps resembling goose flesh
Treatment for keratosis pilaris usually isn't needed. But if you're concerned about your or your child's skin, consult your health care provider or a specialist in skin conditions (dermatologist).Keratosis pilaris is caused by the buildup of keratin â a hard protein that protects skin from harmful substances and infection. The keratin blocks the opening of hair follicles, causing patches of rough, bumpy skin.It's not clear why keratin builds up in people with keratosis pilaris. It might happen along with a genetic disease or skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. Dry skin tends to make keratosis pilaris worse."
325,Atopic Dermatitis,"Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each person. They can include small, hard bumps on the back of the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or cheeks. They often dont itch or cause pain. The bumps may have pale, dry skin scales on top. They may look red. Some of the bumps may have a hair from the follicle twisted inside them."
324,Atopic Dermatitis,"Eczema on the lips, also known as eczematous cheilitis, is inflammation or irritation on the skin of your lips. Itâs sometimes associated with atopic dermatitis. It can lead to dry, scaly or painfully cracked lips. Itâs a more severe form of chapped lips. Chapped lips are usually temporary, but eczema on the lips tends to be long term (chronic)."
323,Atopic Dermatitis,"Eczema on your face, or facial eczema, is a condition that can make the skin on your face dry, flaky and itchy. Eczema prevents your skinâs natural barrier from outside elements to function properly. This makes your skin sensitive, so it can easily react to irritants and allergens in your environment, which cause flares."

302,Atopic Dermatitis,"Symptoms mainly affect the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes (the soft, moist areas just inside the bodys openings).

The disease can cause skin symptoms such as:

A large, discolored lesion on the chest of a person with Hansens disease.
A large, discolored lesion on the chest of a person with Hansens disease.

Discolored patches of skin, usually flat, that may be numb and look faded (lighter than the skin around)
Growths (nodules) on the skin
Thick, stiff or dry skin
Painless ulcers on the soles of feet
Painless swelling or lumps on the face or earlobes
Loss of eyebrows or eyelashes
Symptoms caused by damage to the nerves are:

Numbness of affected areas of the skin
Muscle weakness or paralysis (especially in the hands and feet)
Enlarged nerves (especially those around the elbow and knee and in the sides of the neck)
Eye problems that may lead to blindness (when facial nerves are affected)
Enlarged nerves below the skin and dark reddish skin patch overlying the nerves affected by the bacteria on the chest of a patient with Hansens disease. This skin patch was numb when touched.
Enlarged nerves below the skin and dark reddish skin patch overlying the nerves affected by the bacteria on the chest of a patient with Hansens disease. This skin patch was numb when touched.

Symptoms caused by the disease in the mucous membranes are:

A stuffy nose
Nosebleeds
Since Hansens disease affects the nerves, loss of feeling or sensation can occur. When loss of sensation occurs, injuries such as burns may go unnoticed. Because you may not feel the pain that can warn you of harm to your body, take extra caution to ensure the affected parts of your body are not injured.

If left untreated, the signs of advanced leprosy can include:

Paralysis and crippling of hands and feet
Shortening of toes and fingers due to reabsorption
Chronic non-healing ulcers on the bottoms of the feet
Blindness
Loss of eyebrows
Nose disfigurement
Other complications that may sometimes occur are:

Painful or tender nerves

In severe cases, untreated trench foot can involve the toes, heel, or entire foot."
295,Atopic Dermatitis,"The most common symptom of atopic dermatitis is itching, which can be severe. Other common symptoms include:"
294,Atopic Dermatitis,"Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is often called the âitch that rashes.â This description explains what happens when the condition begins. It tends to start suddenly with very itchy skin. Scratching the itchy skin often causes a rash. A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:Itchy skinDry, scaly areasRed rash (especially on lighter skin tones)Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)Scratch marksRaw skin from scratchingBumps or rashes leaking fluidBlisters that ooze and crust overAfter healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had  atopic dermatitisFlare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:Thickened, scaly, and leatheryCrackedWhen this happens, you may see more lines on your hands, as shown here, or feet.Thickened skin tends to itch most of the time. Treating atopic dermatitis before the skin thickens can help prevent thickened, itchy skin.Where atopic dermatitis develops on the body tends to vary with age. The signs can also differ with race. The following pictures of atopic dermatitis show what you may see.While atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere, babies and young children often develop it on their cheeks, forehead, or scalp. Flare-ups can later also appear on the trunk, legs, or arms. On lighter skin tones, you often see a red rash with bumps (A). Children with darker skin tones may have several bumps with or without redness and darker areas of skin, like on this boyâs forehead (B).Atopic dermatitis is intensely itchy. When babies have itchy skin, they rub against something. The rubbing can cause bumps, which can ooze and then crust over.You may see dry, scaly skin on any area of your babyâs body. If your baby often rubs up against objects to relieve the itch of the dry, scaly skin, your baby may develop raw skin.The discomfort caused by the itch, rash, and dry skin can cause your baby to act fussy or have trouble sleeping. Lack of sleep is common in anyone who has atopic dermatitis, including babies and young children.As children grow and develop, atopic dermatitis often changes. Hereâs what you may see.Between 2 years of age and puberty, the condition often affects these areas of the body. Children with lighter skin tones often develop an itchy rash in the creases of their elbows or backs of their knees. If your child has a darker skin tone, patches tend to form on the fronts of the knees, elbows, and backs of their hands. Other common places for atopic dermatitis to appear are the neck, wrists, and ankles. Children with brown or black skin are more likely than white children to have atopic dermatitis on their trunk.These creases, which are called Dennie-Morgan folds, also develop in people who have asthma or hay fever.Older children and teenagers may have small, itchy bumps on their skin instead of a weepy rash. Scratching can cause the spots to leak fluid and then crust over. On darker skin tones, the bumps tend to be gray to violet-brown in color.Skin that is constantly rubbed or scratched can thicken. This helps protect the skin. Thickened skin is often excessively dry and itches most of the time.Atopic dermatitis usually begins early in life and may go away during childhood or the teen years. Some people continue to have this condition as adults. Itâs also possible for atopic dermatitis to begin when youâre an adult.In adults, atopic dermatitis can take many forms. For some people, the condition looks the same as when they were a child or teenager. Adults may also develop the following:Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis on their hands. In fact, the hands may be the only place adults have the condition.Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis around their eyes. Youâll often see thickened skin thatâs darker than the surrounding skin.If youâve had  atopic dermatitis for years, patches of your skin may have permanently thickened and developed a leathery texture, as shown here. This is caused by years of scratching. The affected skin also tends to look darker (or lighter) than the surrounding skin. The thickened skin can itch all the time, even when you donât have a flare-up.Discolored, extremely dry, and itchy skin: Adults may develop discolored skin thatâs extremely dry and easily irritated. This often develops on the hands or feet, but it can occur anywhere. Some adults have nipple eczema, which can be itchy and painful. The dry, cracked skin and scratching make the skin more susceptible to infection. Infections that people with  atopic dermatitis can develop include: Yellow or golden crusts on the skin, like the ones above this childâs lip, often indicate a staph infection. If you see golden or yellowish crusts, contact your dermatologistâs office.Molluscum contagiosum: Having atopic dermatitis increases the risk of getting this common viral infection, which causes small bumps on the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, dermatologists often recommend treating molluscum, especially if it triggers a flare-up of atopic dermatitis.Eczema herpeticum: This is a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms include dome-shaped blisters and bumps, along with fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In children, babies, and anyone who is immunocompromised, eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care.Many studies find that having atopic dermatitis can cause people to feel anxious, depressed, or both. This is often due to the itch, pain, and problems sleeping. These feelings can also be triggered by flare-ups. Some people say they feel ashamed when others see flare-ups on their skin.When people feel anxious or depressed, they often spend more time alone. This can cause people to feel isolated.While studying atopic dermatitis, researchers have also discovered that some people are more likely than others to develop it. To see if you have an increased risk, go to: "

241,Atopic Dermatitis,"  Atopic dermatitis usually begins in infancy, as early as 3 months of age.  In the early (acute) phase, red, oozing, and crusted areas develop, and sometimes blisters. Itching is often intense.  In the chronic (later) phase, scratching and rubbing create areas that appear dry and thickened (lichenified).     Examples of Atopic Dermatitis             Atopic Dermatitis (Acute)  Atopic dermatitis usually develops in infancy. In the early (acute) phase, the rash appears on the face and then spreads to the neck, scalp, arms, and legs.  Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD.      Atopic Dermatitis (Chronic)  In the chronic (later) phase of atopic dermatitis, the rash often occurs in only one or a few spots, such as on the inner fold of the elbow area seen here.

Â© Springer Science+Business Media                      In infants, rashes on the face spread to the neck, eyelids, scalp, hands, arms, feet, and legs. Large areas of the body may be affected.  In older children and adults, a rash often occurs (and recurs) in only one or a few spots, especially on the front of the neck, the inner folds of the elbows, and behind the knees. Although the color, intensity, and location of the rash vary, the rash always itches. In older children and adults, intense itching is the main symptom. The itching often leads to uncontrollable scratching, triggering a cycle of itching-scratching-itching that makes the problem worse. Continuous scratching causes the skin to thicken (lichenification).   Itching worsens with dry air, irritation, and emotional stress. Common environmental triggers of symptoms include  Excessive bathing or washing Harsh soaps  Presence of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus on the skin Sweating Rough fabrics and wool    Complications of atopic dermatitis    Scratching and rubbing can also tear the skin, leaving an opening for bacteria to enter and cause infections of the skin, tissues below the skin, and nearby lymph nodes.

253,Atopic Dermatitis,"  Atopic dermatitis usually appears in infancy, as early as 3 months of age.  In the acute phase, lesions are intensely pruritic, red, thickened, scaly patches or plaques that may become eroded due to scratching.  In the chronic phase, scratching and rubbing create skin lesions that appear dry and lichenified. Distribution of lesions is age specific. In infants, lesions characteristically occur on the face, scalp, neck, eyelids, and extensor surfaces of the extremities. In older children and adults, lesions occur on flexural surfaces such as the neck and the antecubital and popliteal fossae.

Eczema herpeticum is an infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the skin that is more diffuse and widespread than those in nonatopic patients. Eczema herpeticum is commonly the primary HSV infection, but can also result from recurrent infection, in patients with atopic dermatitis. It manifests as grouped vesicles in areas of active or recent dermatitis, although normal skin can be involved. High fever and adenopathy may develop after several days. Occasionally, this infection can become systemic, which may be fatal. Sometimes the eye is involved, causing a painful corneal lesion.

Patients with atopic dermatitis also have a higher risk of allergic contact reactions. For example, contact allergies to nickel, the most common contact allergen, are twice as common as in nonatopic patients. Frequent use of topical products exposes patients to many potential allergens, and allergic contact dermatitis caused by these products may complicate the treatment of atopic dermatitis.   "
256,Atopic Dermatitis,"  The bumps that occur in keratosis pilaris are small, skin-colored, or red and dry. They appear at hair follicles and make the skin feel rough. Sometimes they have plugs in the center that resemble small pimples. Typically, these bumps do not itch or hurt and cause only cosmetic problems, but sometimes they do cause itching.  The upper arms, thighs, and buttocks are most commonly affected. The face may break out as well, particularly in children.  The bumps are more likely to develop in cold weather and to clear up in the summer. The skin may appear red.   "
147,Atopic Dermatitis,"Dermatitis on the eyelids causes inflammation of the thin, sensitive skin around the eyes. The eyelids become irritated, swollen, dry, and reddened. It can affect one or both of the eyes. If this condition continues, the eyelids can be thickened by lichenification. If it is caused by an irritant or allergen, symptoms typically occur within a few hours or days of contact with a trigger substance. Symptoms should decrease when the trigger substance is removed.

55,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"Scleroderma makes your body produce too much collagen, a protein that you need for healthy skin and tissue. Itâs an autoimmune condition, which means your immune system attacks your body instead of protecting it. Scleroderma can cause lots of symptoms and affect tissue throughout your body. It can also lead to life-threatening complications."
167,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"In general, morphea causes discolored, thickened patches of skin that are oval in shape. The outer edge of the lesion may be lilac, and the patch itself is usually reddish in color. It gradually becomes white or yellow in color toward the center of the oval.The exact symptoms and the severity of those symptoms depends on the type of morphea:This is the most common type. People with plaque-type morphea have three or four oval lesions. The lesions are painless, but might itch.This involves multiple widespread lesions that are larger. Generalized morphea can affect deeper tissues, which might lead to disfigurement. The lesions can also join together.This is a rapidly progressive type of morphea with many plaques that can cover almost your entire body. It spares hands and feet. This type needs the most aggressive treatment.Linear morphea features a single band of thickened, discolored skin. Usually, the indented band runs down an arm or leg, but it might also extend down your forehead. This is referred to as en coup de sabre because it makes the skin look as though itâs been struck by a sword.Linear morphea is the most common type of morphea found in school-aged children. The lesions may extend to the tissue under their skin, even to their muscles and bones, leading to deformities. If linear morphea occurs on their face, it might cause issues with their eyes or alignment of their teeth."

165,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"The signs and symptoms of dermatomyositis can appear suddenly or develop gradually over time. The most common signs and symptoms include:
Skin changes. A violet-colored or dusky red rash develops, most commonly on your face and eyelids and on your knuckles, elbows, knees, chest and back. The rash, which can be itchy and painful, is often the first sign of dermatomyositis.
Muscle weakness. Progressive muscle weakness involves the muscles closest to the trunk, such as those in your hips, thighs, shoulders, upper arms and neck. The weakness affects both the left and right sides of your body, and tends to gradually worsen.

168,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"  Constriction of small arteries in the fingers and toes begins quickly, most often triggered by exposure to cold. It may last minutes or hours. The fingers and toes become pale (pallor) or bluish (cyanosis), usually in patches. Only one finger or toe or parts of one or more may be affected. Numbness, tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, and a burning sensation in the fingers or toes are common. As the episode ends, the affected areas may be redder than usual or bluish. Rewarming the hands or feet restores normal color and sensation.

Small painful sores may appear on the tips of the fingers or toes.     Examples of Raynaud Syndrome             Raynaud Syndrome with Pallor  Lighter areas (pallor) are caused by absence of blood flow due to narrowing of blood vessels. The white areas develop irregularly in the fingers.  Raynaud Syndrome With Cyanosis  The blue areas (cyanosis) at the tips of the fingers are caused by decreased oxygen in the blood because of sluggish blood flow due to partial narrowing of the blood vessels.  Raynaud Syndrome With Sores on Fingers  This person with systemic sclerosis has sores and blue fingertips (cyanosis) due to Raynaud syndrome.            "
164,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"Acrocyanosis is a condition that causes your hands or feet (and sometimes other areas of your body) to turn a bluish, white or gray color. It occurs when an artery tightens for longer than it should (vasospasm), causing your blood vessels to narrow. As a result, your surrounding tissues receive less blood and oxygen and become discolored. Another name for acrocyanosis is peripheral cyanosis."
52,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,Juvenile systemic scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is a condition that causes your childâs skin to become unusually thick and hard. It may also cause symptoms that affect their organs. Systemic means that the condition affects your childâs entire body.

128,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"A rheumatoid nodule is a lump of tissue, or an area of swelling, that appears on the exterior of the skin usually around the olecranon (tip of the elbow) or the interphalangeal joints (finger knuckles), but can appear in other areas. There are four different types of rheumatoid nodules: subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules, cardiac nodules, pulmonary nodules, and central nervous systems nodules. These nodules occur almost exclusively in association with rheumatoid arthritis. Very rarely do rheumatoid nodules occur as rheumatoid nodulosis (multiple nodules on the hands or other areas) in the absence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules can also appear in areas of the body other than the skin. Less commonly they occur in the lining of the lungs or other internal organs. The occurrence of nodules in the lungs of miners exposed to silica dust was known as Caplanâs syndrome. Rarely, the nodules occur at diverse sites on body (e.g., upper eyelid, distal region of the soles of the feet, vulva, and internally in the gallbladder, lung, heart valves, larynx, and spine).

103,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"In general, morphea causes discolored, thickened patches of skin that are oval in shape. The outer edge of the lesion may be lilac, and the patch itself is usually reddish in color. It gradually becomes white or yellow in color toward the center of the oval.The exact symptoms and the severity of those symptoms depends on the type of morphea:This is the most common type. People with plaque-type morphea have three or four oval lesions. The lesions are painless, but might itch.This involves multiple widespread lesions that are larger. Generalized morphea can affect deeper tissues, which might lead to disfigurement. The lesions can also join together.This is a rapidly progressive type of morphea with many plaques that can cover almost your entire body. It spares hands and feet. This type needs the most aggressive treatment.Linear morphea features a single band of thickened, discolored skin. Usually, the indented band runs down an arm or leg, but it might also extend down your forehead. This is referred to as en coup de sabre because it makes the skin look as though itâs been struck by a sword.Linear morphea is the most common type of morphea found in school-aged children. The lesions may extend to the tissue under their skin, even to their muscles and bones, leading to deformities. If linear morphea occurs on their face, it might cause issues with their eyes or alignment of their teeth."

In the case of mucinous carcinoma in the breast, this lump may be felt during a self-exam or a doctor's examination. Mucinous carcinoma can also be detected as a lump during a mammogram or MRI.The tumor, or lump, is the main symptom of mucinous carcinoma. However, in cases affecting the breast, you may have additional symptoms of invasive ductal carcinoma. These include:swelling of the breastpain in the breastpainful nippleretracted nippleirritation or dimpled area of the skinscales or redness of the skin of the breastunderarm lumpdischarge from the nipple that isnât breast milkunusual changes in the appearance of the breast or nippleThe primary symptom in the case of mucinous carcinoma of the colon is blood in the stool.

107,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"The symptoms and severity of the disorder vary from one person to another based on the systems and organs involved.It is very common to experience hardening and tightening of patches of your skin with SS. The patches may be oval-shaped or a straight line that can cover large areas of your skin.Your skin may also appear shiny since itâs so tight with your movement restricted.Raynaudâs phenomenon results from limited cutaneous systemic scleroderma. Here, you will see small blood vessels in your fingers and toes start to constrict, or shrink, in response to cold temperatures or certain emotions.As a result, your fingers and toes may become painful, turn blue, or go numb. SS affects all or some parts of your digestive tract. If the esophagus is involved, you may experience heartburn or swallowing difficulty.Your intestines may also be affected. In that case, you may experience:crampsbloatingdiarrheaconstipationIn your intestines, your body absorbs the nutrients it needs to function. So if your muscles are not working correctly to digest your food, you may experience nutritional deficiencies as a result. SS may affect other organs, including your heart, lungs, and kidneys. When the disease process reaches this point, it may become life threatening without early treatment. Scleroderma renal crisis is a rare but severe complication of SS that remains a significant risk factor for the life threatening progression of the disease.

124,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"The most prominent symptoms of erythromelalgia are episodes of erythema, swelling, a painful deep-aching of the soft tissue (usually either radiating or shooting) and tenderness, along with a painful burning sensation primarily in the extremities. These symptoms are often symmetric and affect the lower extremities more frequently than the upper extremities. Symptoms may also affect the ears and face. For secondary erythromelalgia, attacks typically precede and are precipitated by the underlying primary condition. For primary erythromelalgia, attacks can last from an hour to months at a time and occur infrequently to frequently with multiple times daily. Attacks most frequently occur at night, thus having the potential to greatly interfere with sleep. Common triggers for daytime episodes are exertion, heating of the affected extremities, and alcohol or caffeine consumption, and any pressure applied to the limbs. In some patients sugar and even melon consumption have also been known to provoke attacks. Many of those with primary erythromelalgia avoid wearing shoes or socks as the heat this generates is known to produce erythromelalgia attacks. The coexistence of erythromelalgia and Raynaud's phenomenon is rare, but case studies of patients with both diagnoses have been reported in medical journals. Symptoms may present gradually and incrementally, sometimes taking years to become intense enough for patients to seek medical care.  In other cases symptoms emerge full blown with onset.

Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb.

When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men."

10,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:
Tender, warm, swollen joints
Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity
Fatigue, fever and loss of appetite
Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first â particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet.As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body.About 40% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Areas that may be affected include:
Skin
Eyes
Lungs
Heart
Kidneys
Salivary glands
Nerve tissue
Bone marrow
Blood vessels
Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission â when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place.Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints.Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Normally, your immune system helps protect your body from infection and disease. In rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your joints. It can also cause medical problems with your heart, lungs, nerves, eyes and skin.Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more likely to react to environmental factors â such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria â that may trigger the disease.Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include:
Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis.
Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins in middle age.
Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease.
Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity.
Excess weight. People who are overweight appear to be at a somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis increases your risk of developing:
Osteoporosis. Rheumatoid arthritis itself, along with some medications used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, can increase your risk of osteoporosis â a condition that weakens your bones and makes them more prone to fracture.
Rheumatoid nodules. These firm bumps of tissue most commonly form around pressure points, such as the elbows. However, these nodules can form anywhere in the body, including the heart and lungs.
Dry eyes and mouth. People who have rheumatoid arthritis are much more likely to develop Sjogren's syndrome, a disorder that decreases the amount of moisture in the eyes and mouth.
Infections. Rheumatoid arthritis itself and many of the medications used to combat it can impair the immune system, leading to increased infections. Protect yourself with vaccinations to prevent diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, shingles and COVID-19.
Abnormal body composition. The proportion of fat to lean mass is often higher in people who have rheumatoid arthritis, even in those who have a normal body mass index (BMI).
Carpal tunnel syndrome. If rheumatoid arthritis affects your wrists, the inflammation can compress the nerve that serves most of your hand and fingers.
Heart problems. Rheumatoid arthritis can increase your risk of hardened and blocked arteries, as well as inflammation of the sac that encloses your heart.
Lung disease. People with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk of inflammation and scarring of the lung tissues, which can lead to progressive shortness of breath.
Lymphoma. Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphoma, a group of blood cancers that develop in the lymph system.

190,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"Hard, thickening, or tight skin
This trait is what gives scleroderma its name. Some people develop 1 or 2 patches of hard, thick skin. Others have widespread patches on their body. The hard, thick skin can feel anchored in place. If you have morphea (more-fee-uh), the most common type of scleroderma, the patches may not feel too hard. In time, the hardened skin may soften.

Hair loss and less sweating
Where you have hardened skin, youll often see that the area is shiny, discolored, and has hair loss. The hardened skin also tends to lose its ability to sweat.

Dry skin and itch
Scleroderma causes extremely dry skin, and dry skin itches. The extreme dryness can cause the skin to breakdown and sores can form.

Skin color changes
The patches of hardened skin can be lighter or darker than your natural skin color. Some people develop violet-colored skin, which means that the scleroderma is active and expanding. This patient has darker and lighter (white) areas that are hard to the touch.

This tends to develop on the upper back, chest, or scalp (along the hairline). The skin may feel hard or tight  but not always. If you have a salt-and-pepper look on your skin, you should see a doctor. This can be a sign that you have a type of scleroderma that affects internal organs. The sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better your prognosis (what is likely to happen).

Scleroderma can cause a salt-and-pepper look to the skin
Stiff joints and difficulty moving them
When the hard, thickening, or tight skin forms over a joint (i.e., the jaw, wrist, or finger), the tightness can make it difficult to move that joint. The patient in this picture cannot fully open her hands because of tight skin. Physical therapy can help you keep the full range of motion. Without it, you may lose the ability to fully straighten or bend a finger, elbow, wrist, or other part of your body.

It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin. It is possible for morphea to recur.See your doctor if you notice reddish patches of hardening or thickening skin. Early diagnosis and treatment may help slow the development of new patches and allow your doctor to identify and treat complications before they worsen.The cause of morphea is unknown. It may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system. In people at increased risk of morphea, it could be triggered by injury to the affected area, medications, chemical toxins, an infection or radiation therapy.The condition isn't contagious.Certain factors may affect your risk of developing morphea, including:

Calcinosis
CREST causes thickening and tightening of the skin with deposition of calcific nodules (""calcinosis"").

Raynaud's phenomenon
Raynaud's phenomenon is frequently the first manifestation of CREST/lcSSc, preceding other symptoms by years. Stress and cold temperature induce an exaggerated vasoconstriction of the small arteries, arterioles, and thermoregulatory vessels of the skin of the digits. Clinically this manifests as a white-blue-red transition in skin color. Underlying this transition is pallor and cyanosis of the digits, followed by a reactive hyperemia as they rewarm. When extreme and frequent, this phenomenon can lead to digital ulcerations, gangrene, or amputation. Ulceration can predispose to chronic infections of the involved site.

Esophageal dysmotility
Presents as a sensation of food getting stuck (dysphagia) in the mid- or lower esophagus, atypical chest pain, or cough. People often state they must drink liquids to swallow solid food. This motility problem results from atrophy of the gastrointestinal tract wall smooth muscle. This change may occur with or without pathologic evidence of significant tissue fibrosis.

Sclerodactyly
Though it is the most easily recognizable manifestation, it is not prominent in all patients. Thickening generally only involves the skin of the fingers distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints in CREST. Early in the course of the disease, the skin may appear edematous and inflamed. Eventually, dermal fibroblasts overproduce extracellular matrix leading to increased tissue collagen deposition in the skin. Collagen cross-linking then causes a progressive skin tightening. Digital ischemic ulcers commonly form on the distal fingers in 3050% of patients.

Telangiectasias
Marked telangiectasias (dilated capillaries) occur on the skin of the face, the palmar surface of the hands, and the mucous membranes. Telangiectasias tend to be more numerous in people with other scleroderma related vascular disease (i.e., pulmonary arterial hypertension). The number of telangiectasias and the sites involved tend to increase over time.

Other
Other symptoms of CREST syndrome can be exhaustion, weakness, difficulties with breathing, pain in hands and feet, dizziness and badly healing wounds.

Patients with lcSSc commonly induce pulmonary artery hypertension which may result in cor pulmonale (heart failure due to increased pulmonary artery pressure)."

Localized and disseminated cases are called papular mucinosis or lichen myxedematosus while generalized, confluent papular forms with sclerosis are called scleromyxedema. Frequently, all three forms are regarded as papular mucinosis. However, some authors restrict it to only mild cases. Another form, acral persistent papular mucinosis is regarded as a separate entity.

It may be confined to the fingers (sclerodactyly) and hands, or it may affect most or all of the body. The skin eventually becomes taut, shiny, and hypopigmented or hyperpigmented; the face becomes masklike; and telangiectases may appear on the fingers, chest, face, lips, and tongue. However, in some patients, skin can soften to variable degrees. Subcutaneous calcifications may develop, usually on the fingertips (pulps) and over bony eminences. Digital ulcers are common, especially on the fingertips, overlying the finger joints, or over calcinotic nodules.

Fingers are most commonly affected, but toes, ears or the nose can also change color.When blood flow returns, the area becomes red and then later returns to normal color.The attacks may last from minutes to hours.People with primary Raynaud phenomenon have problems in the same fingers on both sides. Most people do not have much pain. The skin of the arms or legs develops bluish blotches. This goes away when the skin is warmed up.People with secondary Raynaud phenomenon are more likely to have pain or tingling in the fingers. Painful ulcers may form on the affected fingers if the attacks are very bad."

220,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"  Sensations of coldness, burning pain, paresthesias, or intermittent color changes of one or more digits are precipitated by exposure to cold, emotional stress, or vibration. All can be reversed by removing the stimulus. Rewarming the hands accelerates restoration of normal color and sensation. Color changes are clearly demarcated across the digit. They may be triphasic (pallor, followed by cyanosis and after warming by erythema due to reactive hyperemia), biphasic (cyanosis, erythema), or uniphasic (pallor or cyanosis only). Changes are often symmetric. Raynaud syndrome does not occur proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints; it most commonly affects the middle 3 fingers and rarely affects the thumb.

Severe disease is characterized by dysphagia, dysphonia, and/or diaphragmatic weakness. Muscle weakness may progress over weeks to months. However, it takes destruction of 50% of muscle fibers to cause symptomatic weakness (ie, muscle weakness indicates advanced myositis). Patients may have difficulty raising their arms above their shoulders, climbing steps, or rising from a sitting position. Sometimes muscle tenderness and atrophy develop. Patients may require the use of a wheelchair or become bedridden because of weakness of pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. The flexors of the neck may be severely affected, causing an inability to raise the head from the pillow. Involvement of pharyngeal and upper esophageal muscles may impair swallowing and predispose to aspiration. Muscles of the hands, feet, and face are not involved except in inclusion body myositis, in which distal involvement, especially of the hands, is characteristic. Limb contractures rarely develop. Joint manifestations include polyarthralgia or polyarthritis with swelling and other characteristics of nondeforming arthritis. They occur more often in a subset with Jo-1 or other antisynthetase antibodies.

Cardiac involvement, especially conduction disturbances and ventricular dysfunction, can occur. Gastrointestinal symptoms, more common among children, are due to an associated vasculitis and may include abdominal pain, hematemesis, melena, and ischemic bowel perforation. Skin changes, which occur in dermatomyositis, tend to be dusky and erythematous. Photosensitivity and skin ulceration are visible. Periorbital edema with a purplish appearance (heliotrope rash) is relatively specific for dermatomyositis. Elsewhere, the rash may be slightly elevated and smooth or scaly; it may appear on the forehead, V of the neck and shoulders, chest and back, forearms and lower legs, lateral thighs, elbows and knees, medial malleoli, and dorsal aspects of the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints (Gottron papulesâa relatively specific finding). The base and sides of the fingernails may be hyperemic or thickened. Desquamating dermatitis with splitting of the skin may evolve over the radial aspects of the fingers. Subcutaneous and muscle calcification may occur, particularly in children. The primary skin lesions frequently fade completely but may be followed by secondary changes (eg, brownish pigmentation, atrophy, persistent neovascularization, scarring). Rash on the scalp may appear psoriaform and be intensely pruritic.  Characteristic skin changes can occur in the absence of muscle disease, in which case the disease is called amyopathic dermatomyositis.

When symptoms are present, they are nonspecific (eg, dyspepsia, bloating, early satiety, change in bowel habits, urinary frequency). Later, pelvic pain, anemia, cachexia, and abdominal swelling due to ovarian enlargement or ascites usually occur. An adnexal mass, often solid, irregular, and fixed, may be discovered incidentally.

221,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"  Onset of rheumatoid arthritis is usually insidious, often beginning with systemic and joint symptoms. Systemic symptoms include generalized afternoon fatigue and malaise, anorexia, generalized weakness, and occasionally low-grade fever. Joint symptoms include pain, swelling, and stiffness. Occasionally, the disease begins abruptly, mimicking an acute viral syndrome. The disease progresses most rapidly during the first 6 years, particularly the first year; 80% of patients develop some permanent joint abnormalities within 10 years. The course is unpredictable in individual patients. Joint symptoms are characteristically symmetric. Typically, stiffness lasts > 60 minutes after rising in the morning but may occur after any prolonged inactivity (called gelling). Involved joints become tender, with erythema, warmth, swelling, and limitation of motion. The joints primarily involved include the following:  Wrists and the index (2nd) and middle (3rd) metacarpophalangeal joints (most commonly involved) Proximal interphalangeal joints Metatarsophalangeal joint Shoulders Elbows Hips Knees Ankles However, virtually any joint, except the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, may be involved. Initial manifestations include  Monoarthritis of knee, wrist, shoulder, or ankle Polymyalgia rheumaticaâlike presentation predominantly with shoulder and hip girdle involvement, especially in older patients Palindromic rheumatism, characterized by recurrent attacks of joint and tendon sheath pain with swelling Joint swelling without chronic joint damage Robustus rheumatoid arthritis with proliferative synovitis but minimal pain Lower spine involvement is not characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis, but cervical spine inflammation can result in instability, which can become an emergency. Synovial thickening and swelling are often detectable. Joints are often held in flexion to minimize pain, which results from joint capsular distention.

Skin and nail manifestations    Swelling of the skin is usually symmetric and progresses to induration. It may be confined to the fingers (sclerodactyly) and hands, or it may affect most or all of the body. The skin eventually becomes taut, shiny, and hypopigmented or hyperpigmented; the face becomes masklike; and telangiectases may appear on the fingers, chest, face, lips, and tongue. However, in some patients, skin can soften to variable degrees. Subcutaneous calcifications may develop, usually on the fingertips (pulps) and over bony eminences.

312,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"Signs and symptoms of morphea vary depending on the type and stage of the condition. They include:
Reddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back
Patches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center
Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp
A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny
Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone. The condition generally lasts several years and then improves or at times disappears by itself. It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin. It is possible for morphea to recur.See your doctor if you notice reddish patches of hardening or thickening skin. Early diagnosis and treatment may help slow the development of new patches and allow your doctor to identify and treat complications before they worsen.The cause of morphea is unknown. It may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system. In people at increased risk of morphea, it could be triggered by injury to the affected area, medications, chemical toxins, an infection or radiation therapy.The condition isn't contagious.Certain factors may affect your risk of developing morphea, including:
Being white and female. Morphea is most common in white females.
Age. The condition can affect people at any age. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 14 or in the mid-40s.
A family history of morphea. This condition can run in families. People with morphea are more likely to have a family history of morphea and other autoimmune diseases.
Morphea can cause a number of complications, including:
Self-esteem issues. Morphea can have a negative effect on your self-esteem and body image, particularly if discolored patches of skin appear on your arms, legs or face.
Movement problems. Morphea that affects the arms or legs can impair joint mobility.
Widespread areas of hardened, discolored skin. Numerous new patches of hardened, discolored skin may seem to join together, a condition known as generalized morphea.
Loss of hair and sweat glands. Over time, you may lose hair and sweat glands in the affected area.
Eye damage. Children with head and neck morphea may experience unnoticeable but permanent eye damage."
313,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,"Scleroderma's signs and symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected.Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of the skin.The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:
Heartburn
Difficulty swallowing
Bloating
Diarrhea
Constipation
Fecal incontinence
When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men. Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma:
Genetics. People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. This may explain why a small number of scleroderma cases appear to run in families and why some types of scleroderma are more common for certain ethnic groups.
Environmental triggers. Research suggests that, in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medications or drugs. Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. An environmental trigger is not identified for most people.
Immune system problems. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. People who have scleroderma may also have symptoms of another autoimmune disease â such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome.
Scleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the:
Fingertips. In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die.
Lungs. Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs.
Kidneys. A serious kidney complication (scleroderma renal crisis) involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function.
Heart. Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure. Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart.
Teeth. Severe tightening of facial skin can cause your mouth to become smaller and narrower, which may make it hard to brush your teeth or to even have them professionally cleaned. People who have scleroderma often don't produce normal amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more.
Digestive system. Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine.
Joints. The skin over joints can become so tight that it restricts joint flexibility and movement, particularly in the hands."

However, in some people, the skin can soften over time. Sometimes dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia often referred to as spider veins) can appear on the fingers, chest, face, lips, and tongue, and bumps composed of calcium can develop on the fingers, on other bony areas, or at the joints. Sores can develop on the fingertips and knuckles.

Small, itchy areas on your skin, often on your feet or hands.
Sores or blistering.
Swelling.
Pain or stinging.
Changes in skin color.
Seek medical care for chilblains if you:
Have symptoms that are long lasting or go away then flare.
Think you might have an infection.
Have symptoms that aren't improving after two weeks of home care.
Have symptoms that extend into the warm season.
Aren't sure whether you were in below-freezing temperatures, as you might have frostbite.
The exact cause of chilblains is unknown. They may be an unusual reaction of your body to cold followed by rewarming. Rewarming of cold skin can cause small blood vessels under the skin to expand more quickly than nearby larger blood vessels can handle.The following factors increase the risk of chilblains:
Wearing clothing and shoes that are tight or expose skin to the cold. Wearing tightfitting clothing and shoes in cold, damp weather may make you more susceptible to chilblains.
Being a young woman. This condition is most common in females between the ages of 15 and 30.
Being underweight. This condition is most common in people with a low body mass.
Living in cold, humid areas. Your risk of chilblains is higher if you live in an area with high humidity and cold but not freezing temperatures.
Having certain medical conditions. These include Raynaud's phenomenon, connective tissue disease and SARS-CoV-2.
Chilblains symptoms that are long-lasting and develop after repeated exposure to cold and damp conditions can cause scarring and thin skin.To prevent chilblains:
Avoid or limit your exposure to the cold.
When you come in from the cold, rewarm the skin gradually.
Dress in layers of loose clothing and wear mittens, a scarf and a hat, and warm, water-resistant footwear.
Cover all exposed skin as completely as possible when going outside in cold weather.
Keep your hands, feet and face dry and warm.
Keep your home and workplace comfortably warm.

228,Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites,"  The symptoms of snake venom poisoning vary widely, depending on the following:  The size and species of snake The amount and toxicity of the venom injected (related to the size and species of snake) The biteâs location (the farther away from the head and trunk, the less dangerous) The personâs age (very old and very young people are at higher risk) The personâs underlying medical problems    Pit vipers    Bites by most pit vipers rapidly cause pain. Not all bites inject venom, but if the wound oozes, venom was probably injected. Redness and swelling usually follow within 30 to 60 minutes and can affect the entire leg or arm within several hours. Moderate or severe pit viper poisoning commonly causes bruising of the skin 3 to 6 hours after the bite. The skin around the bite appears tight and discolored. Blisters, often filled with blood, may form in the bite area. Without treatment, tissue around the bite may be destroyed. Other symptoms include fever, chills, general weakness, faintness, sweating, anxiety, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some of these symptoms may be caused by terror rather than venom. The gums may bleed, and blood may appear in the personâs vomit, stools, and urine. Breathing difficulties can occur, particularly after Mojave rattlesnake bites. Some people may have chest pain. Hours later, people may have a headache, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, and a dry mouth.    People bitten by a rattlesnake may experience tingling and numbness in the fingers or toes or around the mouth and a metallic or rubbery taste in the mouth.       Coral snakes    Coral snakebites usually cause little or no immediate pain and swelling. More severe symptoms may take several hours to develop. The area around the bite may tingle, and nearby muscles may become weak. Muscle incoordination and severe general weakness may follow. Other symptoms may include double vision, blurred vision, confusion, drowsiness, increased saliva production, and speech and swallowing difficulties. Breathing problems, which may be extreme, may develop.        Is That a Pit Viper?    Pit vipers have certain features that can help distinguish them from nonvenomous snakes:   Vertical slitlike pupils Pits between the eyes and nose Retractable fangs Rows of single scales across the underside of the tail Triangular heads (like an arrowhead) Nonvenomous snakes tend to have the following:   Rounded heads Round pupils No pits No fangs Rows of double scales across the underside of the tail If people see a snake with no fangs, they should not assume it is nonvenomous because the fangs may be retracted.

234,Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites,"  In cutaneous leishmaniasis, a well-demarcated skin lesion develops at the site of a sand fly bite, usually within several weeks to months. Multiple lesions may occur after multiple infective bites or with metastatic spread. Their appearance varies. The initial lesion is often a papule that slowly enlarges, ulcerates centrally, and develops a raised, erythematous border where intracellular parasites are concentrated. Ulcers are typically painless and cause no systemic symptoms unless secondarily infected. Lesions heal spontaneously after several months but may persist for years. They leave a depressed, burn-like scar. The course depends on the infecting Leishmania species and the hostâs immune status.  Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, a rare syndrome, results in widespread nodular skin lesions resembling those of lepromatous leprosy     Leprosy  Leprosy is a chronic infection usually caused by the acid-fast bacilli Mycobacterium leprae or the closely related organism M. lepromatosis. These organisms have a unique tropism...  read more        . It results from cell-mediated anergy to the organism. Mucosal leishmaniasis due to L. braziliensis and related organisms typically starts with one or more primary cutaneous ulcers. Spread to the mucosa via lymphatics and the bloodstream probably occurs early in infection. The skin lesions heal spontaneously; but progressive mucosal lesions may not become apparent for months to years. Typically, patients have nasal stuffiness, discharge, and pain. Over time, the infection may progress, resulting in gross mutilation of the nose, palate, oral pharynx, or face. In visceral leishmaniasis, the clinical manifestations usually develop gradually over weeks to months after inoculation of the parasite but can be acute. Irregular fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with a reversed albumin:globulin ratio occur. In some patients, there are twice-daily temperature spikes. Cutaneous skin lesions rarely occur. Emaciation and death occur within months to years in patients with progressive infections. Those with asymptomatic, self-resolving infections and survivors (after successful treatment) are resistant to further attacks unless cell-mediated immunity is impaired (eg, by AIDS). Relapse may occur years after initial infection.  Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may develop after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis in patients in the Sudan and India. It is characterized by flat or nodular cutaneous lesions that contain many parasites. In patients in the Sudan, these lesions develop at the end of or within 6 months of therapy and spontaneously resolve a few months to a year later. In patients in India and adjacent countries, skin lesions typically develop 1 to 2 years after therapy ends and can last for many years. PKDL lesions are thought to be a reservoir for the spread of infection in these areas.  "

Flea bites produce a variety of effects, ranging from a small, temporary red bump to long-term symptoms that may last for years depending on the sensitivity of the person bitten. The area of skin affected may increase over time, or the rash may spread to a different area. Flea bites can take a very long time to heal and can sometimes evolve into persistent bite reactions. Itching and swelling may occur at the sites of older bites when a person is bitten again."
172,Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites,"Swimmers itch presents within hours of exposure after the film of water has dried on the skin. Initial symptoms are itch or a tingling sensation which settles quickly, leaving tiny red spots where skin penetration by the cercariae has occurred. Intense itch develops over a number of hours and the red spots can enlarge to form papules and, occasionally, hives. Blisters may develop over the next 24 to 48 hours.

The clue to diagnosis is that the rash is usually limited to areas of the skin exposed directly to the water, so skin covered by swimwear is typically protected."

HOW TO TREAT AT HOME
If there is a stinger in your skin, gently scrape it off with your fingernail or the edge of a card. Do NOT pinch the sting out with your fingers or use tweezers as you may spread the venom.
Wash the bite with soap and water, and pat dry.
Place an ice pack (wrap a bag of ice in a towel), then place this on the wound.
Do not scratch the bite as this may cause infection.
If the bite is painful or swollen, consult your neighbourhood pharmacist about over-the-counter medication like Paracetamol or Ibuprofen.
If the wound is itchy or swollen, apply a topical cream containing antihistamines or mild hydrocortisone (1%)."

Severe reactions such as facial swelling, difficulty breathing, and shock (anaphylaxis)
Fever, hives, and painful joints (though these reactions are not as common)
Very few spiders cause severe reactions. The black widow spider may cause only a mild local reaction at the bite site, but pain, stiffness, chills, fever, nausea, and abdominal pain may follow within a few hours.

The bite of a brown spider may cause little or no immediate pain, but some pain develops in the area around the bite within about an hour. Pain may be severe and may affect the entire injured area, which may become red and bruised and may itch. The rest of the body may itch as well. A blister forms, surrounded by a bruised area or by a more distinct red area that resembles a bullâs-eye. Then the blister enlarges, fills with blood, and ruptures, forming an open sore (ulcer) followed by a thick black scar (eschar) that may leave a large crater-like scar.

Severe jellyfish stings can affect multiple body systems. These reactions may appear rapidly or several hours after the stings. Symptoms of severe jellyfish stings include:
Stomach pain, nausea and vomiting
Headache
Muscle pain or spasms
Faintness, dizziness or confusion
Difficulty breathing
Heart problems
The severity of a reaction depends on:
The type and size of the jellyfish
The age, size and health of the person affected, with severe reactions more likely in children
How long the person was exposed to the stingers
How much of the skin is affected
Seek emergency treatment if you have severe symptoms.See your health care provider if your symptoms worsen or the wound shows symptoms of infection.Jellyfish stings are caused by brushing against a jellyfish tentacle. Tentacles have thousands of microscopic barbed stingers. Each stinger has a tiny bulb that holds venom and a coiled, sharp-tipped tube.When you brush against a tentacle, tiny triggers on its surface release the stingers. The tube pierces the skin and releases venom. It affects the area of contact and may enter the bloodstream.Jellyfish that have washed up on a beach may still release venomous stingers if touched.Many types of jellyfish are fairly harmless to humans. Others can cause severe pain and a full-body (systemic) reaction. These jellyfish cause more-serious problems in people:
Box jellyfish. Box jellyfish can cause intense pain and, rarely, life-threatening reactions. The more dangerous species of box jellyfish are in the warm waters of the Pacific and Indian oceans.
Portuguese man-of-war. Also called bluebottle jellyfish, Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish live mostly in warmer seas. This type has a blue or purplish gas-filled bubble that keeps it afloat.
Sea nettle. Common in both warm and cool seawaters.
Lion's mane jellyfish. These are the world's largest jellyfish, with a body diameter of more than 3 feet (1 meter). They're most common in cooler, northern regions of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
Conditions that increase the risk of jellyfish stings:
Swimming when jellyfish appear in large numbers (a jellyfish bloom)
Swimming or diving in jellyfish areas without protective clothing
Playing or sunbathing where jellyfish are washed up on the beach
Swimming in a place known to have many jellyfish
Possible complications of a jellyfish sting include:
Delayed skin reaction, causing blisters, rash or other irritation
Irukandji syndrome, which causes chest and stomach pain, high blood pressure, and heart problems
The following tips can help you avoid jellyfish stings:
Wear a protective suit. When swimming or diving in areas where jellyfish stings are possible, wear a wet suit or other protective clothing. Diving stores sell protective ""skin suits"" or ""stinger suits"" made of thin, high-tech fabric. Consider protective footwear, as stings can also occur while wading in shallow water.
Get information about conditions. Talk to lifeguards, local residents or officials with a local health department before swimming or diving in coastal waters, especially in areas where jellyfish are common.
Avoid water during jellyfish season. Stay out of the water in jellyfish areas when jellyfish numbers are high."

171,Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites,"The signs of CLM typically appear 1 to 5 days after infection, although sometimes it takes longer. Common signs and symptoms include:Red, twisting lesions that grow. CLM presents as a red lesion that has a twisting, snake-like pattern. This is due to the movement of the larvae under your skin. Lesions can move up to 2 centimeters in a day. Itchiness and discomfort. CLM lesions may itch, sting, or be painful. Swelling. Swelling can also be present. Lesions on the feet and backside. CLM can occur anywhere on the body, although it most often occurs on areas likely to be exposed to contaminated soil or sand, such as the feet, buttocks, thighs, and hands.Because CLM lesions can be intensely itchy, they're often scratched. This can break the skin, increasing the risk for a secondary bacterial infection."

93,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Apart from the bumps on the skin, dermatofibromas rarely cause additional symptoms. The growths can range in color from pink to reddish to brown.They are usually between 7 and 10 millimeters in diameter, although they can be smaller or larger than this range.Dermatofibromas are also usually firm to the touch. They can also be mildly sensitive to the touch, although most don't cause symptoms.The growths can occur anywhere on the body but appear more often on exposed areas, such as the legs and arms."
163,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Keloids are usually seen on the neck, ear lobes, legs, arms, and on the upper trunk, especially the chest. They frequently appear in the site of a previous injury. Keloids that arise spontaneously are common on the middle of the chest. Keloids are smooth, shiny, firm to the touch, and may have regular or irregular ridges. In lighter skin colors, they are often skin-colored, pink, or reddish. In darker skin colors, they are skin-colored or any shade of brown. Keloids may grow larger than the original area of injury."
94,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis produces one defining symptom: the appearance of a raised bump (called a papule, or a nodule) on the ear. This bump is usually on the helix or antihelix of a person's ear cartilage.The nodule creates a sensation of pain or pressure when irritated, and it's sensitive to the touch. Some people with CNH report episodes of stabbing pain at the area that last several hours. The nodule often appears spontaneously. However, some patients may have preceding trauma, frostbite, or chronic sun damage prior to the appearance of this lesion. No poking or squeezing of the nodule will shrink or get rid of it, though it may bleed if you try to remove it. "
95,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Epidermoid cysts are often found on the head, neck, back, or genitals. They range in size from very small (millimeters) to inches across. They look like a small bump, and the overlying skin can be skin-colored, whitish, or yellowish in color.

Theyre filled with cheesy-like, white keratin debris. Theyre typically painless. Although, they can become inflamed and irritated. "
308,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Symptoms tend to end when the keloid stops growing, but not always. This man developed keloids on his face after chickenpox cleared. Decades later, the keloids still itch and feel painful.The color of a keloid, like the one on this patients shoulder, can differ from that of your natural skin color. When a keloid first appears, its often red, pink, or slightly darker than your natural skin tone. As it grows, it may darken. Some become lighter in the center and darker at the edges.Some people say their keloid darkens noticeably after they spent time in the sun. This darkening can be permanent.Once a keloid stops growing, it tends to remain the same size. Unlike other scars, a keloid rarely fades without treatment.The keloid you see on your skin can look different from the keloid you see on someone elseâs skin. Sometimes, one keloid on your skin will look very different from another. The following pictures of keloids show how different keloids can look. Most keloids are either round, oval, or oblong. On the chest, arms, or legs, this scar is usually raised and has a flat surface. A keloid on the ear, neck, or belly may hang from the skin.A keloid can range from the size of a pimple to larger than a football.When you touch a keloid, youâre most likely to feel one of these textures. A few keloids have a texture thatâs somewhere in between hard and soft.Most people develop one or two keloids. Some people get several. Youâre more likely to develop many keloids after acne or chickenpox clears, but not always. The girl in this picture developed two keloids after chickenpox cleared.While most keloids are harmless, they can interfere with your life. A keloid can: When a keloid covers a large area or develops over a joint, the hardened, tight scar tissue often limits how far you can move. If this happens, it may affect your ability to reach, walk, and do other activities.A keloid rarely opens upon its own. Like the rest of your skin, you may see a keloid bleeding if you injure it. "
96,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"The symptoms of KA are visual and lasts two to three months. The look is often compared to a small volcano.First, KA shows up as small, round bump. Then, it grows into a lesion or wound and reaches a size of between 1 and 2 centimeters within a few weeks. The wound looks like a dome with a plug made of brown keratin, which is the same material as hair and skin.If the brown keratin comes out, the KA will look like a crater. When it heals, it'll flatten and leave a scar."
162,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Lesions may be single or multiple. They are seen in areas where many oil glands are found, such as the face (nose, cheeks, and forehead), chest, and upper arms.

They are small (2-9 mm), painless, yellowish or sometimes pink or tan papules (small, solid bumps), often with a central depression or dimple."
98,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Keloids come from the overgrowth of scar tissue. Keloid scars tend to be larger than the original wound. They may take weeks or months to fully develop.The symptoms of a keloid can include:a localized area that is flesh-colored, pink, or reda lumpy or ridged area of skin that's usually raisedan area that continues to grow larger with scar tissue over timean itchy patch of skinWhile keloid scars may be itchy, they're usually not harmful to your health. You may experience discomfort, tenderness, or irritation from your clothing or other forms of friction.Keloid scarring can form on large areas of your body, but this is generally rare. When it happens, the hardened, tight scar tissue may restrict your movement.Keloids are often more of a cosmetic concern than a health concern. You may feel self-conscious if a keloid is very large or in a highly visible location, such as on your earlobe or your face."
47,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Fibromas are noncancerous tumors made up of fibrous tissue. They can occur almost anywhere in and on your body. Most fibromas donât cause symptoms. You may not even you know you have one. Fibromas occur for various reasons, but some have unknown causes. Treatment isnât usually necessary unless itâs interfering with your life or causing symptoms."
266,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Epidermoid cyst signs and symptoms include:
A small, round bump under the skin, usually on the face, neck or trunk
A tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst
A thick, yellow, smelly material that sometimes drains from the cyst
Redness, swelling and tenderness in the area, if inflamed or infected
Most epidermoid cysts don't cause problems or need treatment. See your doctor if you have one or more that:
Grows rapidly
Ruptures or becomes painful or infected
Occurs in a spot that's constantly irritated
Bothers you for cosmetic reasons
Is in an unusual location, such as a finger and toe
The surface of your skin (epidermis) is made up of a thin, protective layer of cells that your body continuously sheds. Most epidermoid cysts form when these cells move deeper into your skin and multiply rather than slough off. Sometimes the cysts form due to irritation or injury of the skin or the most superficial portion of a hair follicle.The epidermal cells form the walls of the cyst and then secrete the protein keratin into the interior. The keratin is the thick, yellow substance that sometimes drains from the cyst. This abnormal growth of cells may be due to a damaged hair follicle or oil gland in your skin.Many people refer to epidermoid cysts as sebaceous cysts, but they're different. True sebaceous cysts are less common. They arise from the glands that secrete oily matter that lubricates hair and skin (sebaceous glands).Nearly anyone can develop one or more epidermoid cysts, but these factors make you more susceptible:
Being past puberty
Having certain rare genetic disorders
Injuring the skin
Potential complications of epidermoid cysts include:
Inflammation. An epidermoid cyst can become tender and swollen, even if it's not infected. An inflamed cyst is difficult to remove. Your doctor is likely to postpone removing it until the inflammation subsides.
Rupture. A ruptured cyst often leads to a boil-like infection that requires prompt treatment.
Infection. Cysts can become infected and painful (abscessed).
Skin cancer. In very rare cases, epidermoid cysts can lead to skin cancer."

It's also possible to get them on the scrotum or inside the vagina."
406,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"A keloid scar usually appears a few weeks to years after you damage or injure your skin, such as after a cut, burn or acne.A keloid scar usually grows for months or years and becomes bigger than the original wound.While it's growing, it may feel itchy or painful. This usually stops once it's finished growing.If it's on or near a joint, the joint can be uncomfortable or difficult to move."
49,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"An ear keloid is a type of fibrous scar tissue that forms after an injury. Unlike other types of raised scars, an ear keloid extends beyond the original injured area. They can form anywhere on your ear, including earlobes, cartilage or behind your ears. Most people who have ear keloids develop them after getting their ears pierced."
48,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"A sebaceous adenoma is a small bump on a gland in your skin (sebaceous gland). Itâs a harmless, benign tumor in a hair follicle."
46,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"A seborrheic keratosis (seb-o-REE-ik ker-uh-TOE-sis) is a common benign skin growth, similar to a mole. Most people will have at least one in their lifetime. They tend to appear in mid-adulthood and their frequency increases with age. They are harmless and donât require treatment, but you can have them removed if they bother you."
265,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Cellular dermatofibromas are a type of dermatofibroma (noncancerous tumor). They appear as firm bumps (nodules), often on your legs."
92,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Multiple lesions may appear, although at the beginning there might be just one. Growths can be found anywhere on the body except the soles of the feet, palms, and mucous membranes. A seborrheic keratosis usually causes no symptoms.

306,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"An epidermal inclusion cyst is the most common cutaneous cyst. Epidermal inclusion cysts are also known as epidermal cysts, epidermoid cysts, infundibular cysts and keratin cysts."
180,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"A round or oval-shaped waxy or rough bump, typically on the face, chest, a shoulder or the back
A flat growth or a slightly raised bump with a scaly surface, with a characteristic ""pasted on"" look
Varied size, from very small to more than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) across
Varied number, ranging from a single growth to multiple growths
Very small growths clustered around the eyes or elsewhere on the face, sometimes called flesh moles or dermatosis papulosa nigra, common on Black or brown skin
Varied in color, ranging from light tan to brown or black
Itchiness"
160,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"A small, round bump under the skin, usually on the face, neck or trunk
A tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst
A thick, yellow, smelly material that sometimes drains from the cyst
Redness, swelling and tenderness in the area, if inflamed or infected
Most epidermoid cysts don't cause problems or need treatment. See your doctor if you have one or more that:
Grows rapidly
Ruptures or becomes painful or infected
Occurs in a spot that's constantly irritated
Bothers you for cosmetic reasons
Is in an unusual location, such as a finger and toe
The surface of your skin (epidermis) is made up of a thin, protective layer of cells that your body continuously sheds. Most epidermoid cysts form when these cells move deeper into your skin and multiply rather than slough off. Sometimes the cysts form due to irritation or injury of the skin or the most superficial portion of a hair follicle.The epidermal cells form the walls of the cyst and then secrete the protein keratin into the interior. The keratin is the thick, yellow substance that sometimes drains from the cyst. This abnormal growth of cells may be due to a damaged hair follicle or oil gland in your skin.Many people refer to epidermoid cysts as sebaceous cysts, but they're different. True sebaceous cysts are less common. They arise from the glands that secrete oily matter that lubricates hair and skin (sebaceous glands).

97,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Sebaceous hyperplasia causes yellowish or flesh-colored bumps on the skin. These bumps are shiny and usually on the face, especially the forehead and nose. They're also small, usually between 2 and 4 millimeters wide, and painless.People sometimes mistake sebaceous hyperplasia for basal cell carcinoma, which looks similar. Bumps from basal cell carcinoma are usually red or pink and much larger than those of sebaceous hyperplasia. Your doctor can do a biopsy of the bump to confirm whether you have sebaceous hyperplasia or basal cell carcinoma. "

2,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"yellowish or flesh-colored bumps on the skin. These bumps are shiny and usually on the face, especially the forehead and nose. They are also small, usually between 2 and 4 millimeters wide, and painless. Bumps from basal cell carcinoma are usually red or pink and much larger than those of sebaceous hyperplasia. "
3,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"
Thick, irregular scarring, typically on the earlobes, shoulders, cheeks or middle chest
Shiny, hairless, lumpy, raised skin
Varied size, depending on the size of the original injury and when the keloid stops growing
Varied texture, from soft to firm and rubbery
Reddish, brown or purplish, depending on your skin color
Itchiness
Discomfort

182,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Chondrodermatitis nodularis is a solitary, firm, and oval-shaped nodule, 46 mm in diameter, with central crust and surrounding erythema.

In men, the most common site for CNH is the helix, while in women it is more often found on the antihelix. 
It is typically unilateral, located on the sleeping side, but can be bilateral.
CNH is painful and tender. Pain at night may prevent sleeping on the affected side.
The lesion can bleed or discharge a small amount of scaly material. 
"
181,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"A dermatofibroma usually presents as a solitary firm papule or nodule on a limb.

A dermatofibroma can occur anywhere on the skin.
Dermatofibroma size varies from 0.51.5 cm diameter; most lesions are 710 mm diameter.
A dermatofibroma is tethered to the skin surface and mobile over subcutaneous tissue.
The overlying skin dimples on pinching the lesion  the dimple or pinch sign.
Colour may be pink to light brown in white skin, and dark brown to black in dark skin; some appear paler in the centre.
Dermatofibromas do not usually cause symptoms, but they are sometimes painful, tender, or itchy.
Clinical variants include giant, eruptive, and multiple forms.

Redness, swelling and tenderness in the area, if inflamed or infected"
184,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"On an earlobe, youll likely see a round, solid mass. When a keloid forms on a shoulder or the chest, the raised scar tends to spread out across the skin. It often looks like a liquid spilled on the skin and then hardened.

"
161,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"A keratoacanthoma appears and grows rapidly over the course of 2-6 weeks. Starting as a small, pimple-like lesion, a keratoacanthoma typically develops into a dome-shaped, skin-colored nodule with a central depression filled with keratin (the major protein found in hair, skin, and nails). Keratoacanthomas usually range in size from 1-2 cm.

The most common locations for keratoacanthoma include the:

Center of the face.
Backs of the hands.
Arms.
Ears.
Scalp.
Lower legs, especially in women.
In rare cases, multiple keratoacanthomas may develop. Most keratoacanthomas are painless, but some may be itchy."
330,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Feeling a lump just beneath the skin
It may be painful
The cyst may smell bad
The cyst may become inflamed or red
The cyst may leak fluid or thick material
The symptoms of epidermoid cysts may look like other skin conditions. Always talk with your healthcare provider for a diagnosis"
329,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"The growths can:

Be slightly raised from the surrounding skin
Be white or light tan in appearance, which may darken to brown or black
Have a waxy, pasted-on look
Look scaly or like a wart
Be well-defined from the surrounding skin
Not usually cause pain but may sometimes itch a little
They occur most often on the chest, belly, back, neck, arms, face, or other areas that are exposed to sun. You might have only 1 or up to hundreds of these growths. People tend to develop more of these growths as they age."
