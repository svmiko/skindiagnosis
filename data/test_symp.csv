148,Atopic Dermatitis,"Breast eczema  may affect the nipples, areolae, or surrounding skin, with eczema of the nipples being of the moist type with oozing and crusting, in which painful fissuring is frequently seen, especially in nursing mothers.It will often occur in pregnancy even without breast feeding.
"
150,Atopic Dermatitis,"
Symptoms refer to the sensations that people with AD feel, whereas signs refers to a description of the visible changes that result from AD."
201,Atopic Dermatitis,"Dry, itchy skin
Thick, rough skin that looks dirty, most noticeably on the palms and soles of the feet
White, gray or brown scales on the front of the legs, back of the arms, scalp, back or stomach. If scales appear on the face, its mostly on the forehead and cheeks. Sometimes the edges of the scales curl, making the skin feel rough.
Extra lines on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. The lines may run deep in severe cases, causing cracks in the skin. If the cracks are deep enough, an infection may develop.
Rough bumps on the arms, thighs and buttocks (keratosis pilaris). The bumps are often mistaken for acne blemishes.
Inability to perspire (sweat) adequately. This happens in severe cases and can cause overheating (because perspiration cools down the body).
Many patients dont realize they have ichthyosis vulgaris because symptoms can be so mild. They simply believe their skin is dry, so they apply moisturizer, which can reduce scaling.

Ichthyosis vulgaris tends to get worse during the winter, when cold and dry air can cause symptoms. In the summer, the disease can virtually disappear because of the warm, moist air.

Sometimes patients notice ichthyosis vulgaris symptoms before they are diagnosed with more serious diseases. On the other hand, ichthyosis vulgaris symptoms sometime appear years after patients are diagnosed with more serious conditions.

151,Atopic Dermatitis,"The major symptoms of XLI include scaling of the skin, particularly on the neck, trunk, and lower extremities.  The extensor surfaces are typically the most severely affected areas.  The >4Â mm diameter scales adhere to the underlying skin and can be dark brown or gray in color.  Symptoms may subside during the summer
"
153,Atopic Dermatitis,"The dry scaling appearance is most noticeable during the winter as a result of dry air inside people's homes. During the summer, tanning of the surrounding normal skin makes the pale patches of pityriasis alba more prominent.

"
254,Atopic Dermatitis,"  Symptoms of hand and foot dermatitis include redness, scaling, and thickening of the skin on the hands and feet. These symptoms may progress to itchy small blisters or large blisters on the palms, sides of the fingers, or soles. These blisters can rupture, resulting in oozing and crusting. The blisters may be the first symptom people notice.  Symptoms can come and go. The skin can become infected (for example, by bacteria or fungi).    "
155,Atopic Dermatitis,"Irritant diaper dermatitis (IDD, also called a diaper or nappy rash) is a generic term applied to skin rash in the diaper (in British and Australian English ânappyâ) area that are caused by various skin disorders and/or irritants.
"
157,Atopic Dermatitis,"KP results in small, rough bumps on the surface of the skin. They are skin-colored bumps the size of a grain of sand, many of which are surrounded by a slight pink color in light-skinned people and dark spots in dark-skinned people. Most people with KP do not have symptoms, but the bumps in the skin can occasionally be itchy. Irritation due to scratching KP bumps can result in redness and inflammation.
"
292,Atopic Dermatitis,"Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a condition that causes an itchy rash to develop on your skin. The rash can appear anywhere on your body. Eczema can develop on your nipples as well as your areola (the dark circle of skin surrounding the nipples). This condition affects babies, children and adults of all genders."

Small bumps that ooze fluid."
149,Atopic Dermatitis,"Ichthyosis vulgaris (also known as ""autosomal dominant ichthyosis""[1] and ""Ichthyosis simplex""[1]) is a skin disorder causing dry, scaly skin. It is the most common, and one of the mildest forms of ichthyosis, affecting around 1 in 250 people.[4] For this reason it is known as common ichthyosis. It is usually an autosomal dominant inherited disease (often associated with filaggrin), although a rare non-heritable version called acquired ichthyosis exists.

Tender skin

Burning or stinging

Hives (round welts on the skin that itch intensely)

Fluid-filled blisters

Oozing blisters that leave crusts and scales"
145,Atopic Dermatitis,Contact dermatitis is a localized rash or irritation of the skin caused by contact with a foreign substance. Only the superficial regions of the skin are affected in contact dermatitis. Inflammation of the affected tissue is present in the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin) and the outer dermis (the layer beneath the epidermis).

249,Atopic Dermatitis,"  Atopic dermatitis usually begins in infancy, as early as 3 months of age.  In the early (acute) phase, red, oozing, and crusted areas develop, and sometimes blisters. Itching is often intense.  In the chronic (later) phase, scratching and rubbing create areas that appear dry and thickened (lichenified).     Examples of Atopic Dermatitis             Atopic Dermatitis (Acute)  Atopic dermatitis usually develops in infancy. In the early (acute) phase, the rash appears on the face and then spreads to the neck, scalp, arms, and legs.  Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD.      Atopic Dermatitis (Chronic)  In the chronic (later) phase of atopic dermatitis, the rash often occurs in only one or a few spots, such as on the inner fold of the elbow area seen here.  Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD.      Atopic Dermatitis (Back of Knees)  This photo shows red crusted spots on the back of the knees and legs.  Â© Springer Science+Business Media                      In infants, rashes on the face spread to the neck, eyelids, scalp, hands, arms, feet, and legs. Large areas of the body may be affected.  In older children and adults, a rash often occurs (and recurs) in only one or a few spots, especially on the front of the neck, the inner folds of the elbows, and behind the knees. Although the color, intensity, and location of the rash vary, the rash always itches. In older children and adults, intense itching is the main symptom. The itching often leads to uncontrollable scratching, triggering a cycle of itching-scratching-itching that makes the problem worse. Continuous scratching causes the skin to thicken (lichenification).   Itching worsens with dry air, irritation, and emotional stress. Common environmental triggers of symptoms include  Excessive bathing or washing Harsh soaps  Presence of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus on the skin Sweating Rough fabrics and wool    Complications of atopic dermatitis    Scratching and rubbing can also tear the skin, leaving an opening for bacteria to enter and cause infections of the skin, tissues below the skin, and nearby lymph nodes. Widespread inflammation and scaling of the skin also can develop. In people with atopic dermatitis, infection with the herpes simplex virus     Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections  Herpes simplex virus infection causes recurring episodes of small, painful, fluid-filled blisters on the skin, mouth, lips (cold sores), eyes, or genitals.

248,Atopic Dermatitis,"  Atopic dermatitis usually appears in infancy, as early as 3 months of age.  In the acute phase, lesions are intensely pruritic, red, thickened, scaly patches or plaques that may become eroded due to scratching.  In the chronic phase, scratching and rubbing create skin lesions that appear dry and lichenified. Distribution of lesions is age specific. In infants, lesions characteristically occur on the face, scalp, neck, eyelids, and extensor surfaces of the extremities. In older children and adults, lesions occur on flexural surfaces such as the neck and the antecubital and popliteal fossae.  Intense pruritus     Itching  Itching is a symptom that can cause significant discomfort and is one of the most common reasons for consultation with a dermatologist.

252,Atopic Dermatitis,"  Atopic dermatitis usually begins in infancy, as early as 3 months of age.  In the early (acute) phase, red, oozing, and crusted areas develop, and sometimes blisters. Itching is often intense.  In the chronic (later) phase, scratching and rubbing create areas that appear dry and thickened (lichenified).     Examples of Atopic Dermatitis             Atopic Dermatitis (Acute)  Atopic dermatitis usually develops in infancy. In the early (acute) phase, the rash appears on the face and then spreads to the neck, scalp, arms, and legs.  Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD.      Atopic Dermatitis (Chronic)  In the chronic (later) phase of atopic dermatitis, the rash often occurs in only one or a few spots, such as on the inner fold of the elbow area seen here.  Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD.      Atopic Dermatitis (Back of Knees)  This photo shows red crusted spots on the back of the knees and legs.  Â© Springer Science+Business Media                      In infants, rashes on the face spread to the neck, eyelids, scalp, hands, arms, feet, and legs. Large areas of the body may be affected.  In older children and adults, a rash often occurs (and recurs) in only one or a few spots, especially on the front of the neck, the inner folds of the elbows, and behind the knees. Although the color, intensity, and location of the rash vary, the rash always itches. In older children and adults, intense itching is the main symptom. The itching often leads to uncontrollable scratching, triggering a cycle of itching-scratching-itching that makes the problem worse. Continuous scratching causes the skin to thicken (lichenification).   Itching worsens with dry air, irritation, and emotional stress. Common environmental triggers of symptoms include  Excessive bathing or washing Harsh soaps  Presence of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus on the skin Sweating Rough fabrics and wool    Complications of atopic dermatitis    Scratching and rubbing can also tear the skin, leaving an opening for bacteria to enter and cause infections of the skin, tissues below the skin, and nearby lymph nodes.

242,Atopic Dermatitis,"     Irritant contact dermatitis    Acute ICD is more painful than pruritic. Signs range from erythema, scaling, and edema to erosions, crusting, and blistering. Chronic and cumulative ICD is more often pruritic.       Allergic contact dermatitis    ACD is more pruritic than painful. Skin changes range from erythema, scaling, and edema, through vesiculation to severe swelling with bullae. Changes often occur in a pattern, distribution, or combination that suggests a specific exposure, such as linear streaking on an arm or leg (eg, due to brushing against poison ivy) or circumferential erythema (under a wristwatch or waistband). Linear streaks are almost always indicative of an external allergen or irritant.  The site of contact is where the allergen contacted the skin, very often the hands, because they touch so many substances. Although the palms and the palmar sides of the fingers are most exposed, ACD often starts in the web spaces between fingers because the thick stratum corneum prevents or delays allergen penetration on the palms and palmar sides of the fingers (also on the soles). With airborne exposure (eg, perfume aerosols), areas not covered by clothing are predominantly affected. Although ACD is typically limited to the site of contact, it may later spread because of scratching and autoeczematization (id reaction, a dermatitis at sites remote from the site of the initial inflammatory problem or infection). Because of the time needed to recruit and expand T cells in the epidermis, ACD typically takes â¥ 1 day after exposure to become noticeable and takes 2 to 3 days to become further aggravated (crescendo reaction). (In contrast, ICD typically decreases in intensity [decrescendo reaction] after 1 or 2 days.)        Pearls & Pitfalls     Lesion shape or pattern (linear streaks are almost always indicative of an external allergen or irritant) can help differentiate contact dermatitis from other forms of dermatitis.

198,Atopic Dermatitis,"It tends to start suddenly with very itchy skin. Scratching the itchy skin often causes a rash.

A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.

Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:

Itchy skin

Dry, scaly areas

Red rash (especially on lighter skin tones)

Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)

Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)

Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)

Scratch marks

Raw skin from scratching

Bumps or rashes leaking fluid

Blisters that ooze and crust over

After healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had atopic dermatitis

Flare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.

Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.

Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:

63,Scabies Lyme Diease and other Infestations and Bites,"Chiggers (trombiculidae) are a species of mite, and are a close relative to spiders and ticks. Chiggers are microscopic and are almost invisible to the naked eye. Once chiggers hatch from eggs (larva), the mites feed on the skin tissue of a host (human or animal) before falling off and turning into an adult mite. Found around the world, chiggers live outdoors on plants in wooded or grassy areas, typically around water. They are most active during the summer months when temperatures are hot."

158,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"Seborrheic keratoses can occur anywhere on the body, except for the palms, soles, and mucous membranes (areas such as in the mouth or anus). They most commonly occur on the chest and back. Seborrheic keratoses do not go away on their own, and they do not become cancerous.

They usually start as light brown or skin-colored, slightly raised areas, which can be round or oval and of varying size (usually smaller than a thumbnail, but sometimes much larger). As they grow thicker, seborrheic keratoses may become dark brown to almost black and appear to be stuck on to the surface of the skin. The surface may feel smooth or rough. In lighter skin colors, they may be pink or any shade of brown. In darker skin colors, they may be any shade of brown, purple, gray, or blackish."

They generally do not change in size over the years, but older dermatofibromas may be flat or soft."
211,Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,"  Rosacea is limited to the face and scalp and manifests in 4 phases:  Pre-rosacea Vascular Inflammatory Late In the pre-rosacea phase, patients describe embarrassing flushing and blushing, often accompanied by uncomfortable stinging. Common reported triggers for these flares include sun exposure, emotional stress, cold or hot weather, alcohol, spicy foods, exercise, wind, cosmetics, and hot baths or hot drinks. These symptoms persist throughout other phases of the disorder. In the vascular phase, patients develop facial erythema and edema with multiple telangiectases, possibly as a result of persistent vasomotor instability.   An inflammatory phase often follows, in which sterile papules and pustules (leading to the designation of rosacea as adult acne) develop.   The late phase (developing in some patients), is characterized by coarse tissue hyperplasia of the cheeks and nose (rhinophyma) caused by tissue inflammation, collagen deposition, and sebaceous gland hyperplasia.   The phases of rosacea are usually sequential. Some patients go directly into the inflammatory stage, bypassing the earlier stages. Treatment may cause rosacea to return to an earlier stage. Progression to the late stage is not inevitable. Ocular rosacea often precedes or accompanies facial rosacea and manifests as some combination of blepharoconjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis, and keratitis, causing itching, foreign body sensation, erythema, and edema of the eye.
