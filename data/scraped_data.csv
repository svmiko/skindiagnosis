They may include:
Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent.
Reduced central vision in one or both eyes.
The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work.
Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater.
Increased blurriness of printed words.
Difficulty recognizing faces.
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.
Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness.Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss.See your eye doctor if:
You notice changes, such as distortion or blind spots, in your central vision.
You lose the ability to see fine detail.
These changes may be the first sign of macular degeneration, particularly if you're over age 60.No one knows exactly what causes dry macular degeneration. Research indicates that it may be a combination of family genes and environmental factors, including smoking, obesity and diet.The condition develops as the eye ages. Dry macular degeneration affects the macula. The macula is the area of the retina that's responsible for clear vision in the direct line of sight. Over time, tissue in the macula may thin and lose cells responsible for vision.Factors that may increase your risk of macular degeneration include:
Age. This disease is most common in people over 60.
Family history and genetics. This disease has a hereditary component. Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition.
Race. Macular degeneration is more common in white people.
Smoking. Smoking cigarettes or being regularly exposed to tobacco smoke greatly increases your risk of macular degeneration.
Obesity. Research indicates that being obese may increase your chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to the more severe form of the disease.
Cardiovascular disease. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.
People whose dry macular degeneration has progressed to central vision loss have a higher risk of depression and social isolation. With profound loss of vision, people may see visual hallucinations. This condition is called Charles Bonnet syndrome. Dry macular degeneration may progress to wet macular degeneration, which can quickly cause vision loss if left untreated.It's important to have routine eye exams to identify early signs of macular degeneration. The following measures may help reduce your risk of developing dry macular degeneration:
Manage all medical conditions. For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your health care provider's instructions for controlling the condition.
Don't smoke. Smokers are more likely to develop macular degeneration than are nonsmokers. Ask your provider for help stopping smoking.
Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly. If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.
Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration.
Include fish in your diet. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids.

These itchy bumps, which dermatologists call ""nodules,"" can develop anywhere on skin that you can scratch, pick, or rub. While the itchy bumps can develop anywhere, most appear on one or more of these areas:Arms, Legs, Upper back, Lower back, Buttocks, Abdomen. The following describes what you may experience if you have prurigo nodularis. Before the itchy bumps of prurigo nodularis appear, the skin often itches. This itch can be long-lasting or come in short bursts. Either way, it's often intense. Some people have a few itchy areas. For others, the itch covers much of their skin.Instead of feeling itchy, some people say that their skin burns or stings. While rare, patients have said they experience other sensations, like the feeling that bugs are crawling on their skin.The repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing leads to itchy bumps. The itchy bumps usually appear about six weeks after your skin starts to itch, burn, or sting. Often, the bumps develop evenly on both sides of the body.The bumps can be the color of your skin, pink, red, or brownish black. The size may vary from that of a pinhead to larger than a U.S. quarter. Itâ€™s possible to have a few bumps or more than 100 on your skin. For most people, this number falls somewhere in between.Raised, itchy patches can also develop on the skin. Frequently scratching can cause more bumps and raised patches of itchy skin. The more you scratch, the itchier your skin may feel. Some people scratch until the itchy bumps or patches break open and bleed or the skin feels too painful to touch. All this scratching can cause changes. Dark spots may appear. The skin can feel pebbly or hard and thick.Without treatment, the itch and bumps can last for months or years (A). As the bumps clear, you may see flat dark spots (B), spots that are lighter than your natural skin color, or scars where the bumps once were.Living with severe and frequent itch can affect your quality of life.

Patches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center
Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp
A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny
Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone. The condition generally lasts several years and then improves or at times disappears by itself. It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin. It is possible for morphea to recur.See your doctor if you notice reddish patches of hardening or thickening skin. Early diagnosis and treatment may help slow the development of new patches and allow your doctor to identify and treat complications before they worsen.The cause of morphea is unknown. It may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system. In people at increased risk of morphea, it could be triggered by injury to the affected area, medications, chemical toxins, an infection or radiation therapy.The condition isn't contagious.Certain factors may affect your risk of developing morphea, including:
Being white and female. Morphea is most common in white females.
Age. The condition can affect people at any age. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 14 or in the mid-40s.
A family history of morphea. This condition can run in families. People with morphea are more likely to have a family history of morphea and other autoimmune diseases.
Morphea can cause a number of complications, including:
Self-esteem issues. Morphea can have a negative effect on your self-esteem and body image, particularly if discolored patches of skin appear on your arms, legs or face.
Movement problems. Morphea that affects the arms or legs can impair joint mobility.
Widespread areas of hardened, discolored skin. Numerous new patches of hardened, discolored skin may seem to join together, a condition known as generalized morphea.
Loss of hair and sweat glands. Over time, you may lose hair and sweat glands in the affected area.

When the skin warms and blood flow improves, the affected areas may change color again, throb, tingle or swell.Raynaud's most commonly affects fingers and toes. But it also can affect other areas of the body, such as nose, lips, ears and even nipples. After warming up, the return of blood flow to the area can take 15 minutes.See your health care provider right away if you have a history of severe Raynaud's and get a sore or infection in one of your affected fingers or toes.Experts don't fully understand the cause of Raynaud's attacks. But blood vessels in the hands and feet appear to react too strongly to cold temperatures or stress.With Raynaud's, arteries to the fingers and toes narrow when exposed to cold or stress. The narrowed arteries limit blood flow. Over time, these small arteries can thicken slightly and limit blood flow even more.

Tender, warm, swollen joints
Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity
Fatigue, fever and loss of appetite
Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first â€” particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet.As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body.About 40% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Areas that may be affected include:
Skin
Eyes
Lungs
Heart
Kidneys
Salivary glands
Nerve tissue
Bone marrow
Blood vessels
Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission â€” when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place.Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints.Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Normally, your immune system helps protect your body from infection and disease. In rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your joints. It can also cause medical problems with your heart, lungs, nerves, eyes and skin.Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more likely to react to environmental factors â€” such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria â€” that may trigger the disease.Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include:
Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis.
Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins in middle age.
Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease.
Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity.
Excess weight. People who are overweight appear to be at a somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis increases your risk of developing:
Osteoporosis. Rheumatoid arthritis itself, along with some medications used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, can increase your risk of osteoporosis â€” a condition that weakens your bones and makes them more prone to fracture.
Rheumatoid nodules. These firm bumps of tissue most commonly form around pressure points, such as the elbows. However, these nodules can form anywhere in the body, including the heart and lungs.
Dry eyes and mouth. People who have rheumatoid arthritis are much more likely to develop Sjogren's syndrome, a disorder that decreases the amount of moisture in the eyes and mouth.
Infections. Rheumatoid arthritis itself and many of the medications used to combat it can impair the immune system, leading to increased infections. Protect yourself with vaccinations to prevent diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, shingles and COVID-19.
Abnormal body composition. The proportion of fat to lean mass is often higher in people who have rheumatoid arthritis, even in those who have a normal body mass index (BMI).
Carpal tunnel syndrome. If rheumatoid arthritis affects your wrists, the inflammation can compress the nerve that serves most of your hand and fingers.
Heart problems. Rheumatoid arthritis can increase your risk of hardened and blocked arteries, as well as inflammation of the sac that encloses your heart.
Lung disease. People with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk of inflammation and scarring of the lung tissues, which can lead to progressive shortness of breath.
Lymphoma. Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphoma, a group of blood cancers that develop in the lymph system.

In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. 
Heartburn
Difficulty swallowing
Bloating
Diarrhea
Constipation
Fecal incontinence
When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men.",,

Cellulitis. Cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin. It causes redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too.
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced by the staph bacteria may cause staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition includes a fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off. This leaves a red, raw surface that looks like a burn.",,same as 75

The symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap. And the symptoms don't always happen in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis bacteria without noticing any symptoms for years.

Primary syphilis
The first symptom of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore is often painless. It appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. Most people with syphilis develop only one chancre. Some people get more than one.

The chancre often forms about three weeks after you come in contact with syphilis bacteria. Many people who have syphilis don't notice the chancre. That's because it's usually painless. It also may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre heals on its own within 3 to 6 weeks.

Secondary syphilis
You may get a rash while the first chancre heals or a few weeks after it heals.

A rash caused by syphilis:

Often is not itchy.
May look rough, red or reddish-brown.
Might be so faint that it's hard to see.
The rash often starts on the trunk of the body. That includes the chest, stomach area, pelvis and back. In time, it also could appear on the limbs, the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.

Along with the rash, you may have symptoms such as:

Wartlike sores in the mouth or genital area.
Hair loss.
Muscle aches.
Fever.
Sore throat.
Tiredness, also called fatigue.
Weight loss.
Swollen lymph nodes.
Symptoms of secondary syphilis may go away on their own. But without treatment, they could come and go for months or years.

Latent syphilis
If you aren't treated for syphilis, the disease moves from the secondary stage to the latent stage. This also is called the hidden stage because you have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years. Your symptoms may never come back. But without treatment, the disease might lead to major health problems, also called complications.

Tertiary syphilis
After the latent stage, up to 30% to 40% of people with syphilis who don't get treatment have complications known as tertiary syphilis. Another name for it is late syphilis.

Blisters inside the mouth and throat
Scalp blistering and hair loss (scarring alopecia)
Skin that looks thin
Tiny pimple-like bumps (milia)
Dental problems, such as tooth decay
Difficulty swallowing
Itchy, painful skin
Usually epidermolysis bullosa blisters are noticed during infancy. But it's not uncommon for them to appear when a toddler first begins to walk or when an older child begins new activities that cause more friction on the soles of the feet.Contact your health care provider if you or your child develops blisters for an unknown reason. For infants, severe blistering can be life-threatening.Seek immediate medical care if you or your child:
Has problems swallowing
Has problems breathing
Shows signs of infection, such as warm, painful or swollen skin, pus, or an odor from a sore, and fever or chills
Epidermolysis bullosa is caused by an inherited gene. You may inherit the disease gene from one parent who has the disease (autosomal dominant inheritance) or from both parents (autosomal recessive inheritance).The skin is made up of an outer layer (epidermis) and an underlying layer (dermis). The area where the layers meet is called the basement membrane. The types of epidermolysis bullosa are mainly defined by which layers separate and form blisters. The skin injury might be brought on by a minor injury, bump or nothing at all.The main types of epidermolysis bullosa are:
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex. This is the most common type. It's brought on by heat and friction and develops in the outer layer of skin. It mainly affects the palms and feet. The blisters heal without scarring.
Junctional epidermolysis bullosa. This type may be severe, with blisters beginning in infancy. A baby with this condition may develop a hoarse-sounding cry from continual blistering and scarring of the vocal cords.
Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. This type is related to a flaw in the gene that helps produce a protein that glues the skin layers together. If this protein is missing or doesn't function, the layers of the skin won't join properly. It can cause skin that looks thin. Diseased mucous membranes can cause constipation and make it hard to eat.
Kindler syndrome. This type tends to cause blisters in multiple layers and so can look very different from person to person. The blisters tend to show up in infancy or early childhood. It increases sun sensitivity and causes skin to look thin, mottled and wrinkly.
Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is distinct from these conditions, as it isn't inherited and it's rare in children.The major risk factor for developing epidermolysis bullosa is having a family history of the disorder.Epidermolysis bullosa can worsen even with treatment, so it's important to spot signs of complications early. Complications may include:
Infection. Blistering skin can become infected by bacteria.
Bloodstream infection. Sepsis occurs when bacteria from an infection enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. Sepsis can spread rapidly and lead to shock and organ failure.
Fusion of fingers and changes in the joints. Severe forms of epidermolysis bullosa can bind together fingers or toes and cause unusual bending of the joints (contractures). This can affect the function of the fingers, knees and elbows.
Problems with nutrition. Blisters in the mouth can make eating difficult and lead to malnutrition and anemia, such as low iron levels in the blood. Problems with nutrition can also cause delayed wound healing and slowed growth in children.
Constipation. Difficulty passing stool may be due to painful blisters in the anal area. It can also be caused by not ingesting enough liquids or high-fiber foods, such as fruits and vegetables.
Dental problems. Tooth decay and problems with tissues inside the mouth are common with some types of epidermolysis bullosa.
Skin cancer. Teenagers and adults with certain types of epidermolysis bullosa are at increased risk of a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.
Death. Infants with severe junctional epidermolysis bullosa are at high risk of infections and loss of body fluids from widespread blistering. Blisters in the mouth and throat also make it harder to eat and breathe. Many of these infants don't survive.
It's not possible to prevent epidermolysis bullosa. But these steps may help prevent blisters and infection.
Handle your child gently. Your infant or child needs cuddling, but be very gentle. To pick up a child with epidermolysis bullosa, place the child on soft material and give support under the buttocks and behind the neck. Don't lift the child from under the arms.
Take special care with the diaper area. If your child wears diapers, remove the elastic bands and avoid cleansing wipes. Line the diaper with a nonstick dressing or spread it with a thick layer of zinc oxide paste.
Keep the home environment cool. Try to keep your home cool and the temperature steady.
Keep the skin moist. Gently apply moisturizer as needed throughout the day.
Dress your child in soft clothes. Use soft clothing that's simple to get on and off. It may help to remove labels and put on clothing seam-side out to reduce scratching. Try sewing foam pads into the lining of clothing by elbows, knees and other pressure points. Use soft special shoes, if possible.
Prevent scratching. Trim your child's fingernails regularly.
Encourage your child to be active. As your child grows, encourage activities that reduce the risk of skin injury. Swimming is a good option. For children with mild forms of epidermolysis bullosa, they can protect the skin by wearing long pants and sleeves for outdoor activities.
Cover hard surfaces. Consider padding a car seat or bathing tub with sheepskin, foam or a thick towel. Soft cotton or silk can be used as a top layer over the padding.

Redness, irritation and pain under dentures (denture stomatitis)
In severe cases, usually related to cancer or a weakened immune system from HIV/AIDS, the lesions may spread downward into your esophagus â€” the long, muscular tube stretching from the back of your mouth to your stomach (Candida esophagitis). If this occurs, you may experience difficulty swallowing and pain or feel as if food is getting stuck in your throat.In addition to the distinctive white mouth lesions, infants may have trouble feeding or be fussy and irritable. They can pass the infection to their mothers during breast-feeding. The infection may then pass back and forth between the mother's breasts and the baby's mouth.Women whose breasts are infected with candida may experience these signs and symptoms:
Unusually red, sensitive, cracked or itchy nipples
Shiny or flaky skin on the darker, circular area around the nipple (areola)
Unusual pain during nursing or painful nipples between feedings
Stabbing pains deep within the breast
If you or your child develops white lesions inside the mouth, see your doctor or dentist.Thrush is uncommon in healthy older children, teenagers and adults, so if thrush develops, see your doctor to determine if further evaluation is needed to check for an underlying medical condition or other cause.Normally, your immune system works to repel harmful invading organisms, such as viruses, bacteria and fungi, while maintaining a balance between ""good"" and ""bad"" microbes that normally inhabit your body. But sometimes these protective mechanisms fail, increasing the number of candida fungus and allowing an oral thrush infection to take hold.The most common type of candida fungus is Candida albicans. Several factors, such as a weakened immune system, can increase your risk of oral thrush.You may have an increased risk of oral thrush infection if any of these issues apply:
Weakened immunity. Oral thrush is more likely to occur in infants and older adults due to reduced immunity. Some medical conditions and treatments can suppress your immune system, such as cancer and its treatments, organ transplantation and required drugs that suppress the immune system, and HIV/AIDS.
Diabetes. If you have untreated diabetes or the disease isn't well-controlled, your saliva may contain large amounts of sugar, which encourages the growth of candida.
Vaginal yeast infections. Vaginal yeast infections are caused by the same fungus that causes oral thrush. You can pass the infection to your baby.
Medications. Drugs such as prednisone, inhaled corticosteroids, or antibiotics that disturb the natural balance of microorganisms in your body can increase your risk of oral thrush.
Other oral conditions. Wearing dentures, especially upper dentures, or having conditions that cause dry mouth can increase the risk of oral thrush.
Oral thrush is seldom a problem for healthy children and adults.For people with lowered immunity, such as from cancer treatment or HIV/AIDS, thrush can be more serious. Untreated oral thrush can lead to more-serious systemic candida infections. If you have a weakened immune system, thrush may spread to your esophagus or other parts of your body.These measures may help reduce your risk of developing candida infections:
Rinse your mouth. If you need to use a corticosteroid inhaler, be sure to rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth after taking your medication.
Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily or as often as your dentist recommends.
Check your dentures. Remove your dentures at night. Make sure dentures fit properly and don't cause irritation. Clean your dentures daily. Ask your dentist for the best way to clean your type of dentures.
See your dentist regularly, especially if you have diabetes or wear dentures. Ask your dentist how often you need to be seen.
Watch what you eat. Try limiting the amount of sugar-containing foods you eat. These may encourage the growth of candida.
Maintain good blood sugar control if you have diabetes. Well-controlled blood sugar can reduce the amount of sugar in your saliva, discouraging the growth of candida.
Treat a vaginal yeast infection as soon as possible.
Treat dry mouth. Ask your doctor about ways to avoid or treat your dry mouth.

Generalized. This type is uncommon and usually affects adults. It causes bumps that form a rash on most of the body, including the trunk, arms and legs. The rash might cause discomfort or itchiness.
Under the skin. A type that usually affects young children is called subcutaneous granuloma annulare. It produces small, firm lumps under the skin, instead of a rash. The lumps form on the hands, shins and scalp.

Symptoms may vary, depending on which organs are affected.Signs and symptoms of amyloidosis may include:
Severe fatigue and weakness
Shortness of breath
Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet
Swelling of the ankles and legs
Diarrhea, possibly with blood, or constipation
An enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge
Skin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and purplish patches around the eyes
See your health care provider if you regularly experience any of the signs or symptoms associated with amyloidosis.There are many different types of amyloidosis. Some types are hereditary. Others are caused by outside factors, such as inflammatory diseases or long-term dialysis. Many types affect multiple organs. Others affect only one part of the body.Types of amyloidosis include:
AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis). This is the most common type of amyloidosis in developed countries. AL amyloidosis is also called primary amyloidosis. It usually affects the heart, kidneys, liver and nerves.
AA amyloidosis. This type is also known as secondary amyloidosis. It's usually triggered by an inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It most commonly affects the kidneys, liver and spleen.
Hereditary amyloidosis (familial amyloidosis). This inherited disorder often affects the nerves, heart and kidneys. It most commonly happens when a protein made by your liver is abnormal. This protein is called transthyretin (TTR).
Wild-type amyloidosis. This variety has also been called senile systemic amyloidosis. It occurs when the TTR protein made by the liver is normal but produces amyloid for unknown reasons. Wild-type amyloidosis tends to affect men over age 70 and often targets the heart. It can also cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
Localized amyloidosis. This type of amyloidosis often has a better prognosis than the varieties that affect multiple organ systems. Typical sites for localized amyloidosis include the bladder, skin, throat or lungs. Correct diagnosis is important so that treatments that affect the entire body can be avoided.
Factors that increase the risk of amyloidosis include:
Age. Most people diagnosed with amyloidosis are between ages 60 and 70.
Sex. Amyloidosis occurs more commonly in men.
Other diseases. Having a chronic infectious or inflammatory disease increases the risk of AA amyloidosis.
Family history. Some types of amyloidosis are hereditary.
Kidney dialysis. Dialysis can't always remove large proteins from the blood. If you're on dialysis, abnormal proteins can build up in your blood and eventually be deposited in tissue. This condition is less common with more modern dialysis techniques.
Race. People of African descent appear to be at higher risk of carrying a genetic mutation associated with a type of amyloidosis that can harm the heart.
Amyloidosis can seriously damage the:
Heart. Amyloid reduces the heart's ability to fill with blood between heartbeats. Less blood is pumped with each beat. This can cause shortness of breath. If amyloidosis affects the heart's electrical system, it can cause heart rhythm problems. Amyloid-related heart problems can become life-threatening.
Kidneys. Amyloid can harm the kidneys' filtering system. This affects their ability to remove waste products from the body. It can eventually cause kidney failure.
Nervous system. Nerve damage can cause pain, numbness, or tingling of the fingers and feet. If amyloid affects the nerves that control bowel function, it can cause periods of alternating constipation and diarrhea. Damage to the nerves that control blood pressure can make people feel faint if they stand up too quickly.

Itching
Soreness or a burning feeling
Easy bruising
Fragile skin
Changes in the tube for urine flow (urethra)
Bleeding, blistering or open sores
Painful sex
See your health care provider if you have symptoms of lichen sclerosus.If you've already been diagnosed with lichen sclerosus, see your health care provider every 6 to 12 months. These visits are important to check for any skin changes or side effects of treatment.The exact cause of lichen sclerosus isn't known. It's likely a combination of factors, including an overactive immune system, your genetic makeup, and previous skin damage or irritation.Lichen sclerosus isn't contagious and can't be spread through sexual contact.Anyone can get lichen sclerosus, but the risk is higher for:
Postmenopausal women
Children younger than 10 years old
Women who have another autoimmune disease, such as forms of low thyroid function (hypothyroidism)
Men with urinary incontinence or an uncircumcised penis
People with a family history of the disease
Complications of lichen sclerosus include painful sex and scarring, including covering of the clitoris. Scarring of the penis can cause painful erection, poor urine flow and an inability to retract the foreskin.People with vulvar lichen sclerosus are also at an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma.In children, constipation is a common complication.

With NLD, skin lesions start as firm, smooth, red bumps (papules) on the shins and lower part of the legs. They usually appear in the same areas on opposite sides of the body. They are painless in the early stage.

As the papules become bigger, they flatten. They develop a shiny yellow brown center with raised red to purplish edges. Veins are visible below the yellow part of the lesions. The lesions are irregularly round or oval with well-defined borders. They can spread and join together to give the appearance of a patch.

Lesions can also occur on the forearms. Rarely, they may occur on the stomach, face, scalp, palms, and soles of the feet.

Trauma may cause the lesions to develop ulcers. Nodules also may develop. The area may become very itchy and painful.

NLD is different from ulcers that can occur on the feet or ankles in people with diabetes.",,

Neurofibromatosis 1
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is usually diagnosed during childhood. Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity.

Signs and symptoms include:

Flat, light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spots are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing.
Freckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling usually appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds.
Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.
Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age.
Bone deformities. Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg.
Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumors usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults.
Learning disabilities. Impaired thinking skills are common in children who have NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.
Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.
Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height.
Neurofibromatosis 2
Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Also known as vestibular schwannomas, these tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain.

Signs and symptoms generally appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms can include:

Gradual hearing loss
Ringing in the ears
Poor balance
Headaches
Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. People who have NF2 may also develop other benign tumors.

Signs and symptoms of these tumors can include:

Numbness and weakness in the arms or legs
Pain
Balance difficulties
Facial drop
Vision problems or cataracts
Seizures
Headache
Schwannomatosis
This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between ages 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis causes tumors to develop on the cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves — but rarely on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, so people who have schwannomatosis don't experience the same hearing loss as people who have NF2.

Symptoms of schwannomatosis include:

Chronic pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling
Numbness or weakness in various parts of the body
Loss of muscle",,

Skin
The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.

With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:

Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).
Sunburn and no ability to tan.
For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.

Hair
Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.

Eye color
Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.

With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.

Vision
Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:

Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.
An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.

Symptoms also can vary among people with the condition. Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms.Acute porphyrias include forms of the disease that usually cause nervous system symptoms. A few forms also can affect the skin. Symptoms appear quickly and can be severe. Symptoms may last hours, days or weeks.The most common form of acute porphyria is called acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP may last hours or days. Intermittent means that the symptoms may go away but return later. When the symptoms occur they are sometimes called attacks.Symptoms of acute porphyrias may include:
Severe pain in the belly, chest, legs or back.
Digestive problems, such as constipation, nausea and vomiting.
Muscle pain, tingling, numbness, weakness or paralysis.
Red or brown urine.
Mental changes, such as anxiety, hallucinations or mental confusion.
Rapid or irregular heartbeats you can feel, called palpitations.
Breathing problems.
High blood pressure.
Seizures.
Cutaneous porphyrias include forms of the disease that cause skin symptoms as a result of sensitivity to sunlight. These forms usually don't affect the nervous system. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of all the porphyrias.Sun exposure may cause:
Sensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain in the skin.
Sudden painful skin redness and swelling.
Blisters on exposed skin, usually the hands, arms and face.
Fragile thin skin with changes in skin color.
Itching.
Too much hair growth in affected areas.
Red or brown urine.
Erythropoietic protoporphyria (uh-rith-roe-poi-ET-ik pro-toe-por-FEAR-e-uh), also called EPP, is a rare type of cutaneous porphyria. It's the most common childhood porphyria. Sun or artificial light exposure quickly results in painful skin burning, irritation and swelling. Small bumps and blisters also appear. Repeated exposures can cause thick, leathery skin and scarring.Many symptoms of porphyria are like those of other, more common conditions. This can make it difficult to know if you're having an attack of porphyria. If you have symptoms that could be porphyria, get medical attention. Prompt treatment is important.All types of porphyria involve a problem making heme. Heme is a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Heme also plays a role in clearing drugs and hormones from the body.Heme is made in the bone marrow and liver. This process involves eight different enzymes that turn porphyrins into heme. A shortage or change in any of these enzymes causes a buildup of porphyrins. Which enzyme is affected determines the type of porphyria.In cutaneous porphyrias, porphyrins build up in the skin. When exposed to sunlight, they cause symptoms. In acute porphyrias, the buildup affects the nervous system, causing symptoms.Most forms of porphyria are caused by a gene change passed down from one or both parents. Porphyria can occur if you inherit:
A changed gene from one of your parents (autosomal dominant pattern).
Changed genes from both parents (autosomal recessive pattern).
Just because you inherit a gene or genes that can cause porphyria doesn't mean that you'll have symptoms. You might never have symptoms. This also is the case for most carriers of the changed genes.Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) usually is not passed down in families. In PCT, certain triggers can cause a buildup of porphyrins that may cause symptoms. Examples of triggers include:
Too much iron in the body, often due to a condition called hemochromatosis, which is caused by a gene change.
Viral infections, such as HIV or hepatitis C.
Heavy alcohol use.
Smoking.
Hormones changes during the menstrual period.
In addition to genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors may trigger symptoms in porphyria. When exposed to the trigger, the body's demand for heme production increases. This overwhelms the low level of a needed enzyme, setting in motion a process that causes a buildup of porphyrins.Examples of triggers include:
Exposure to sunlight.
Certain medicines, for example, birth control pills, sedatives and barbiturates.
Recreational or illicit drugs.
Dieting or fasting.
Smoking.
Physical stress, such as infections or other illnesses or surgery.
Emotional stress.
Alcohol use.
Hormone changes during the menstrual period.
Possible complications depend on the form of porphyria:
Acute porphyrias can be life-threatening if an attack isn't promptly treated. During an attack, you may experience dehydration from loss of fluids, breathing problems, seizures or high blood pressure. You may need a stay in the hospital for treatment. Long-term complications with repeat acute attacks may include long-term pain, chronic kidney failure, liver damage or liver cancer.
Cutaneous porphyrias can result in permanent skin damage. And the skin blisters can become infected. When your skin heals after symptoms, it may have a changed appearance and coloring, be fragile and slow to heal, or leave scars. Cutaneous porphyrias also increase the risk of liver damage or liver cancer.
In rare cases, a bone marrow transplant or liver transplant may be needed.Although there's no way to prevent porphyria, if you have the condition, avoid triggers to help prevent symptoms.Because porphyria is usually an inherited disorder, your siblings and other family members may want to consider genetic testing to determine if they have the condition. Genetic counseling is important to help understand test results and risks.

Symptoms may include:
Itchiness that can be painful.
Dry, cracked, scaly skin, more typical on white skin.
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on skin color.
Blisters, perhaps with oozing and crusting.
Dandruff.
Thickened skin.
Small, raised bumps, more typical on brown or Black skin.
See your doctor if:
You're so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities.
Your skin is painful.
You have a skin infection â€” look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs.
You have symptoms even after trying self-care steps.
Seek immediate medical attention if you have a fever and the rash looks infected.A common cause of dermatitis is contact with something that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction. Examples of such things are poison ivy, perfume, lotion and jewelry containing nickel. Other causes of dermatitis include dry skin, a viral infection, bacteria, stress, genetic makeup and a problem with the immune system.Common risk factors for dermatitis include:
Age. Dermatitis can occur at any age, but atopic dermatitis is more common in children than adults. It often begins in infancy.
Allergies, atopic dermatitis and asthma. People who have a personal or family history of atopic dermatitis, allergies, hay fever or asthma are more likely to develop atopic dermatitis.
Occupation. Jobs that put you in contact with certain metals, solvents or cleaning supplies increase your risk of contact dermatitis. Being a health care worker is linked to hand eczema.
Other health conditions. Health conditions that put you at increased risk of seborrheic dermatitis include Parkinson's disease, immunodeficiency and HIV/AIDS.
Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and fungi. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening, though this is rare.In people with brown and Black skin, dermatitis might cause the affected skin to darken or lighten. These conditions are called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. It might take months or years for the skin to return to its usual color.Wear protective clothing if you're doing a task that involves irritants or caustic chemicals.Developing a basic skin care routine also may help prevent dermatitis. The following habits can help reduce the drying effects of bathing:
Take shorter baths and showers. Limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes. Use lukewarm, not hot, water. Bath oil also may be helpful.
Use a mild soap or a soapless cleanser. Choose a cleanser that has no dyes, alcohols and fragrance. Some soaps can dry the skin. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean â€” no soap or bubble bath needed. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.
Pat dry. After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Avoid aggressive rubbing.

Moisturize all the skin. While the skin is still damp, seal in moisture with an oil, cream or lotion. Moisturize throughout the day as needed.
Many moisturizers are sold. Try different products to find one that works for you. The ideal moisturizer is safe, unscented, effective, affordable and one that you like to use regularly. Examples include Vanicream, Eucerin, CeraVe and Cetaphil.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (uh-rith-roe-poi-ET-ik pro-toe-por-FEAR-e-uh), also called EPP, is a rare type of cutaneous porphyria. It's the most common childhood porphyria. Sun or artificial light exposure quickly results in painful skin burning, irritation and swelling. Small bumps and blisters also appear. Repeated exposures can cause thick, leathery skin and scarring.Many symptoms of porphyria are like those of other, more common conditions. This can make it difficult to know if you're having an attack of porphyria. If you have symptoms that could be porphyria, get medical attention. Prompt treatment is important.All types of porphyria involve a problem making heme. Heme is a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Heme also plays a role in clearing drugs and hormones from the body.Heme is made in the bone marrow and liver. This process involves eight different enzymes that turn porphyrins into heme. A shortage or change in any of these enzymes causes a buildup of porphyrins. Which enzyme is affected determines the type of porphyria.In cutaneous porphyrias, porphyrins build up in the skin. When exposed to sunlight, they cause symptoms. In acute porphyrias, the buildup affects the nervous system, causing symptoms.Most forms of porphyria are caused by a gene change passed down from one or both parents. Porphyria can occur if you inherit:
A changed gene from one of your parents (autosomal dominant pattern).
Changed genes from both parents (autosomal recessive pattern).
Just because you inherit a gene or genes that can cause porphyria doesn't mean that you'll have symptoms. You might never have symptoms. This also is the case for most carriers of the changed genes.Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) usually is not passed down in families. In PCT, certain triggers can cause a buildup of porphyrins that may cause symptoms. Examples of triggers include:
Too much iron in the body, often due to a condition called hemochromatosis, which is caused by a gene change.
Viral infections, such as HIV or hepatitis C.
Heavy alcohol use.
Smoking.
Hormones changes during the menstrual period.
In addition to genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors may trigger symptoms in porphyria. When exposed to the trigger, the body's demand for heme production increases. This overwhelms the low level of a needed enzyme, setting in motion a process that causes a buildup of porphyrins.Examples of triggers include:
Exposure to sunlight.
Certain medicines, for example, birth control pills, sedatives and barbiturates.
Recreational or illicit drugs.
Dieting or fasting.
Smoking.
Physical stress, such as infections or other illnesses or surgery.
Emotional stress.
Alcohol use.
Hormone changes during the menstrual period.
Possible complications depend on the form of porphyria:
Acute porphyrias can be life-threatening if an attack isn't promptly treated. During an attack, you may experience dehydration from loss of fluids, breathing problems, seizures or high blood pressure. You may need a stay in the hospital for treatment. Long-term complications with repeat acute attacks may include long-term pain, chronic kidney failure, liver damage or liver cancer.
Cutaneous porphyrias can result in permanent skin damage. And the skin blisters can become infected. When your skin heals after symptoms, it may have a changed appearance and coloring, be fragile and slow to heal, or leave scars. Cutaneous porphyrias also increase the risk of liver damage or liver cancer.
In rare cases, a bone marrow transplant or liver transplant may be needed.Although there's no way to prevent porphyria, if you have the condition, avoid triggers to help prevent symptoms.Because porphyria is usually an inherited disorder, your siblings and other family members may want to consider genetic testing to determine if they have the condition. Genetic counseling is important to help understand test results and risks.

Patchy loss of skin color, which usually first appears on the hands, face, and areas around body openings and the genitals
Premature whitening or graying of the hair on your scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows or beard
Loss of color in the tissues that line the inside of the mouth and nose (mucous membranes)
Vitiligo can start at any age, but usually appears before age 30.Depending on the type of vitiligo you have, it may affect:
Nearly all skin surfaces. With this type, called universal vitiligo, the discoloration affects nearly all skin surfaces.
Many parts of the body. With this most common type, called generalized vitiligo, the discolored patches often progress similarly on corresponding body parts (symmetrically).
Only one side or part of the body. This type, called segmental vitiligo, tends to occur at a younger age, progress for a year or two, then stop.
One or only a few areas of the body. This type is called localized (focal) vitiligo.
The face and hands. With this type, called acrofacial vitiligo, the affected skin is on the face and hands, and around body openings, such as the eyes, nose and ears.
It's difficult to predict how this disease will progress. Sometimes the patches stop forming without treatment. In most cases, pigment loss spreads and eventually involves most of the skin. Occasionally, the skin gets its color back.",,

They may include:
Dry, cracked skin
Itchiness (pruritus)
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin
Oozing and crusting
Thickened skin
Darkening of the skin around the eyes
Raw, sensitive skin from scratching
Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years. For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.Talk with a health care provider if you or your child:
Has symptoms of atopic dermatitis
Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities
Has a skin infection â€” look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs
Has symptoms even after trying self-care steps
Seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has a fever and the rash looks infected.In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors â€” such as tobacco smoke.In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function.A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms.Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn't contagious.The main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk.Complications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include:
Asthma and hay fever. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.
Food allergies. People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).
Chronic itchy, scaly skin. A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.
Patches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area. This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.
Skin infections. Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.
Irritant hand dermatitis. This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.
Allergic contact dermatitis. This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.
Sleep problems. The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.
Mental health conditions. Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis.
Developing a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing:

Moisturize your skin at least twice a day. Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. Choose a product or products that work well for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented.
Using petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis.

Take a daily bath or shower. Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.
Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean â€” no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.
Pat dry. After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).
The triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare.Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include:
Rough wool fabric
Dry skin
Skin infection
Heat and sweat
Stress
Cleaning products
Dust mites and pet dander
Mold
Pollen
Smoke from tobacco
Cold and dry air
Fragrances
Other irritating chemicals
Infants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow's milk. Talk with your child's health care provider about identifying potential food allergies.Once you understand what triggers your eczema, talk with your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms and prevent flares.

0,Atopic Dermatitis,Contact Dermatitis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/contact-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352742,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/contact-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352742,"Contact dermatitis shows up on skin that has been directly exposed to the substance causing the reaction. For example, the rash may show up along a leg that brushed against poison ivy. The rash can develop within minutes to hours of exposure, and it can last 2 to 4 weeks.Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis vary widely and may include:
An itchy rash
Leathery patches that are darker than usual (hyperpigmented), typically on brown or Black skin
Dry, cracked, scaly skin, typically on white skin
Bumps and blisters, sometimes with oozing and crusting
Swelling, burning or tenderness
See your health care provider if:
The rash is so itchy that you can't sleep or go about your day
The rash is severe or widespread
You're worried about how your rash looks
The rash doesn't get better within three weeks
The rash involves the eyes, mouth, face or genitals
Seek immediate medical care in the following situations:
You think your skin is infected. Clues include fever and pus oozing from blisters.
It's hard to breathe after inhaling burning weeds.
Your eyes or nasal passages hurt after inhaling smoke from burning poison ivy.
You think an ingested substance has damaged the lining of your mouth or digestive tract.
Contact dermatitis is caused by exposure to a substance that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction. The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants. Often people have irritant and allergic reactions at the same time.Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common type. This nonallergic skin reaction occurs when an irritant damages your skin's outer protective layer.Some people react to strong irritants after a single exposure. Others may develop a rash after repeated exposures to even mild irritants, such as soap and water. And some people develop a tolerance to the substance over time.Common irritants include:
Solvents
Rubber gloves
Bleach and detergents
Hair products
Soap
Airborne substances
Plants
Fertilizers and pesticides
Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when a substance to which you're sensitive (allergen) triggers an immune reaction in your skin. It often affects only the area that came into contact with the allergen. But it may be triggered by something that enters your body through foods, flavorings, medicine, or medical or dental procedures (systemic contact dermatitis).People often become sensitized to allergens after many contacts with it over years. Once you develop an allergy to a substance, even a small amount of it can cause a reaction.Common allergens include:
Nickel, which is used in jewelry, buckles and many other items
Medications, such as antibiotic creams
Balsam of Peru, which is used in many products, such as perfumes, toothpastes, mouth rinses and flavorings
Formaldehyde, which is in preservatives, cosmetics and other products
Personal care products, such as body washes, hair dyes and cosmetics
Plants such as poison ivy and mango, which contain a highly allergenic substance called urushiol
Airborne allergens, such as ragweed pollen and spray insecticides
Products that cause a reaction when you're in the sun (photoallergic contact dermatitis), such as some sunscreens and cosmetics
Children develop allergic contact dermatitis from the usual offenders and also from exposure to diapers, baby wipes, jewelry used in ear piercing, clothing with snaps or dyes, and so on.The risk of contact dermatitis may be higher in people who have certain jobs and hobbies. Examples include:
Agricultural workers
Cleaners
Construction workers
Cooks and others who work with food
Florists
Hair stylists and cosmetologists
Health care workers, including dental workers
Machinists
Mechanics
Scuba divers or swimmers, due to the rubber in face masks or goggles
Contact dermatitis can lead to an infection if you repeatedly scratch the affected area, causing it to become wet and oozing. This creates a good place for bacteria or fungi to grow and may cause an infection.You can take the following steps to help prevent contact dermatitis:
Avoid irritants and allergens. Try to identify and avoid the cause of your rash. For ear and body piercings, use jewelry made of hypoallergenic material, such as surgical steel or gold.
Wash your skin. For poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac, you might be able to remove most of the rash-causing substance if you wash your skin right away after coming into contact with it. Use a mild, fragrance-free soap and warm water. Rinse completely. Also wash any clothing or other items that may have come into contact with a plant allergen, such as poison ivy.
Wear protective clothing or gloves. Face masks, goggles, gloves and other protective items can shield you from irritating substances, including household cleansers.
Apply an iron-on patch to cover metal fasteners next to your skin. This can help you avoid a reaction to jean snaps, for example.
Apply a barrier cream or gel. These products can provide a protective layer for your skin. For example, a nonprescription skin cream containing bentoquatam (Ivy Block) may prevent or lessen your skin's reaction to poison ivy.
Use moisturizer. Regularly applying moisturizing lotions can help restore your skin's outermost layer and keep your skin supple.
Take care around pets. Allergens from plants, such as poison ivy, can cling to pets and then be spread to people. Bathe your pet if you think it got into poison ivy or something similar.

Developing a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing:

Moisturize your skin at least twice a day. Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. Choose a product or products that work well for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented.
Using petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis.

Take a daily bath or shower. Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.
Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean â€” no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.
Pat dry. After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).
The triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare.Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include:
Rough wool fabric
Dry skin
Skin infection
Heat and sweat
Stress
Cleaning products
Dust mites and pet dander
Mold
Pollen
Smoke from tobacco
Cold and dry air
Fragrances
Other irritating chemicals
Infants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow's milk. Talk with your child's health care provider about identifying potential food allergies.Once you understand what triggers your eczema, talk with your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms and prevent flares.

They may include:
Dry, cracked skin
Itchiness (pruritus)
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin
Oozing and crusting
Thickened skin
Darkening of the skin around the eyes
Raw, sensitive skin from scratching
Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years. For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.Talk with a health care provider if you or your child:
Has symptoms of atopic dermatitis
Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities
Has a skin infection â€” look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs
Has symptoms even after trying self-care steps
Seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has a fever and the rash looks infected.In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors â€” such as tobacco smoke.In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function.A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms.Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn't contagious.The main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk.Complications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include:
Asthma and hay fever. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.
Food allergies. People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).
Chronic itchy, scaly skin. A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.
Patches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area. This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.
Skin infections. Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.
Irritant hand dermatitis. This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.
Allergic contact dermatitis. This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.
Sleep problems. The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.

Signs and symptoms of dry skin might vary based on your age, health status, skin tone, living environment and sun exposure. They include:
A feeling of skin tightness
Skin that feels and looks rough
Itchiness (pruritus)
Slight to severe flaking skin, which causes the ashy look that can affect dry brown and black skin
Slight to severe scaling or peeling
Cracked ""dry riverbed"" look to leg
Fine lines or cracks
Skin that ranges from reddish on white skin to grayish on brown and black skin
Deep cracks that may bleed
Most cases of dry skin respond well to lifestyle changes and home remedies. You may need help from your primary care doctor or a doctor who specializes in skin conditions (dermatologist) if:
You've tried self-care steps but your signs and symptoms persist
Your skin becomes inflamed or painful
You develop dry, thick skin as a side effect of cancer treatment
Your condition makes you so uncomfortable that you're losing sleep or are distracted from your daily routines
You have open sores or infections from scratching
You have large areas of scaly or peeling skin
Dry skin is due to water loss from the outer layer of skin. It might be caused by:
Heat. Central heating, wood-burning stoves, space heaters and fireplaces all reduce humidity.
Environment. Living in cold, windy conditions or low-humidity climates.
Too much bathing or scrubbing. Taking long, hot showers or baths or scrubbing your skin too much can dry your skin. Bathing more than once a day can remove the natural oils from your skin too.
Harsh soaps and detergents. Many popular soaps, detergents and shampoos strip moisture from your skin because they are formulated to remove oil.
Other skin conditions. People with skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) or psoriasis are more likely to have dry skin.
Medical treatments. Some people develop dry, thick skin after undergoing treatment for cancer, receiving dialysis or taking certain medications.
Aging. As people age, the skin thins and produces less of the oils needed for the skin to retain water.
Anyone can develop dry skin. But you're more likely to develop the condition if you:
Are over 40, as the skin's ability to retain moisture diminishes with age
Live in cold, windy conditions or low-humidity climates
Have a job that requires you to immerse your hands in water, such as nursing or hairstyling
Use your hands to work with cement, clay or soil
Swim frequently in chlorinated pools
Have certain diseases or conditions, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes or malnutrition
Dry skin is usually harmless. But when it's not cared for, dry skin may lead to:
Atopic dermatitis (eczema). If you're prone to develop this condition, excessive dryness can lead to activation of the disease, causing a rash and cracking skin.
Infections. Dry skin may crack, allowing bacteria to enter, causing infections.
These complications are most likely to occur when your skin's protective mechanisms are severely compromised. For example, severely dry skin can cause deep cracks or fissures, which can open and bleed, providing an avenue for invading bacteria.Try these tips to help your skin retain moisture:
Moisturize. Moisturizer seals in water to help keep your skin's protective barrier healthy. Use moisturizer throughout the day, especially on the hands. And before going outdoors, use a moisturizer that contains sunblock or a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously and reapply every two hours â€” or more often if you're swimming or sweating.
Limit water exposure. Keep bath and shower time to 10 minutes or less. Use warm, not hot, water. Rinse and pat dry. Try to bathe no more than once a day.
Use a gentle cleanser or allergen-free soap. Try a nonsoap cleansing cream or shower gel. Or use fragrance-free moisturizing soap with no alcohol or allergy-causing substances (hypoallergenic soap), especially if you handwash often. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Apply a moisturizing cream while your skin is still damp.
Shave with care. Shaving can be drying. If you shave, use a lubricating agent before you start. Shave in the direction of hair growth, unless that irritates your skin. Use a sharp blade and rinse it with warm water after each stroke. When done, apply moisturizer.
Cover as much skin as possible in cold or windy weather. Harsh weather can be especially drying to skin. Scarves, hats, and gloves or mittens help protect your skin when you're outdoors.
Wear gloves. Protect your hands with suitable gloves when gardening, using harsh cleansers and doing other skin-drying activities.
Rinse and moisturize after swimming. This is especially important if you've been swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool.
Drink when you're thirsty. Drink noncaffeinated beverages each day to help keep all your body's tissues, including your skin, well hydrated.
Bathe babies with care. For babies, using a cleanser every 1-2 weeks for bathing usually is enough. Otherwise, bathe them in just water. However, clean their diaper area with each diaper change. Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly (Vaseline, Aquaphor, others) while the skin is still damp.

Symptoms include:
Painless tiny bumps on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks
Dry, rough skin in the areas with bumps
Worsening when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin
Sandpaper-like bumps resembling goose flesh
Treatment for keratosis pilaris usually isn't needed. But if you're concerned about your or your child's skin, consult your health care provider or a specialist in skin conditions (dermatologist).Keratosis pilaris is caused by the buildup of keratin â€” a hard protein that protects skin from harmful substances and infection. The keratin blocks the opening of hair follicles, causing patches of rough, bumpy skin.It's not clear why keratin builds up in people with keratosis pilaris. It might happen along with a genetic disease or skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. Dry skin tends to make keratosis pilaris worse.

In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:
Heartburn
Difficulty swallowing

When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men. Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma:
Genetics. People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. This may explain why a small number of scleroderma cases appear to run in families and why some types of scleroderma are more common for certain ethnic groups.
Environmental triggers. Research suggests that, in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medications or drugs. Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. An environmental trigger is not identified for most people.
Immune system problems. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. People who have scleroderma may also have symptoms of another autoimmune disease â€” such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome.
Scleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the:
Fingertips. In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die.
Lungs. Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs.
Kidneys. A serious kidney complication (scleroderma renal crisis) involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function.
Heart. Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure. Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart.
Teeth. Severe tightening of facial skin can cause your mouth to become smaller and narrower, which may make it hard to brush your teeth or to even have them professionally cleaned. People who have scleroderma often don't produce normal amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more.
Digestive system. Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine.
Joints. The skin over joints can become so tight that it restricts joint flexibility and movement, particularly in the hands.

Small, fleshy, grainy bumps
Rough to the touch
Sprinkled with black pinpoints, which are small, clotted blood vessels
See your doctor for common warts if:
The growths are painful or change in appearance or color
You've tried treating the warts, but they persist, spread or recur
The growths are bothersome and interfere with activities
You aren't sure whether the growths are warts
You are an adult and numerous warts begin to appear, which may indicate the immune system is malfunctioning
Common warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus is quite common and has more than 150 types, but only a few cause warts on your hands. Some strains of HPV are acquired through sexual contact. Most forms, however, are spread by casual skin contact or through shared objects, such as towels or washcloths. The virus usually spreads through breaks in your skin, such as a hangnail or a scrape. Biting your nails also can cause warts to spread on your fingertips and around your nails.Each person's immune system responds to the HPV virus differently, so not everyone who comes in contact with HPV develops warts.People at higher risk of developing common warts include:
Children and young adults, because their bodies may not have built up immunity to the virus
People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or people who've had organ transplants
To reduce your risk of common warts:
Avoid direct contact with warts. This includes your own warts.
Don't pick at warts. Picking may spread the virus.
Don't use the same emery board, pumice stone or nail clipper on your warts as you use on your healthy skin and nails. Use a disposable emery board.
Don't bite your fingernails. Warts occur more often in skin that has been broken. Nibbling the skin around your fingernails opens the door for the virus.
Groom with care. And avoid brushing, clipping or shaving areas that have warts. If you must shave, use an electric razor.

The rash often lasts about 5 to 10 days. Other symptoms that may appear 1 to 2 days before the rash include:
Fever.
Loss of appetite.
Headache.
Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell.
Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases:
Raised bumps called papules, which break out over a few days.
Small fluid-filled blisters called vesicles, which form in about one day and then break and leak.
Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take a few more days to heal.
New bumps keep showing up for several days. So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears. And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over. The disease is by and large mild in healthy children. But sometimes, the rash can cover the whole body. Blisters may form in the throat and eyes. They also may form in tissue that lines the inside of the urethra, anus and vagina.If you think you or your child might have chickenpox, call your health care provider. Often, chickenpox can be diagnosed with an exam of the rash and other symptoms. You may need medicines that can help fight off the virus or treat other health problems that can happen because of chickenpox. To avoid infecting others in the waiting room, call ahead for an appointment. Mention that you think you or your child may have chickenpox.Also, let your provider know if:
The rash spreads to one or both eyes.
The rash gets very warm or tender. This might be a sign that the skin is infected with bacteria.
You have more serious symptoms along with the rash. Watch for dizziness, new confusion, fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, shakiness, loss of the ability to use muscles together, a cough that becomes worse, vomiting, stiff neck or a fever higher than 102 F (38.9 C).
You live with people who've never had chickenpox and haven't gotten the chickenpox vaccine yet.
Someone in your household is pregnant.
You live with someone who has a disease or takes medicines that affect the immune system.
A virus called varicella-zoster causes chickenpox. It can spread through direct contact with the rash. It also can spread when a person with chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you breathe in the air droplets.Your risk of getting infected with the virus that causes chickenpox is higher if you haven't already had chickenpox or if you haven't had the chickenpox vaccine. It's extra important for people who work in child care or school settings to be vaccinated.Most people who have had chickenpox or have gotten the vaccine are immune to chickenpox. If you've been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder. You may have fewer blisters and mild or no fever. A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare.Chickenpox is often a mild disease. But it can be serious and can lead to other health problem including:
Infected skin, soft tissues, bones, joints or bloodstream caused by bacteria.
Dehydration, when the body runs too low on water and other fluids.
Pneumonia, an illness in one or both lungs.
Swelling of the brain called encephalitis.
Toxic shock syndrome, a dangerous complication of some illnesses caused by bacteria.
Reye's syndrome, a disease that causes swelling in the brain and liver. This can happen in children and teens who take aspirin during chickenpox.
In very rare cases, chickenpox could lead to death.People who are at higher risk of chickenpox complications include:
Newborns and infants whose mothers never had chickenpox or the vaccine. This includes children under age 1, who have not yet had the vaccine.
Teens and adults.
Pregnant women who haven't had chickenpox.
People who smoke.
People with cancer or HIV who are taking medication that has an effect on the immune system.
People with a chronic condition, such as asthma, who take medicine that calms immune response. Or those who have had an organ transplant and take medicine to limit the immune system's action.
Low birth weight and limb problems are more common in babies born to women who are infected with chickenpox early in their pregnancies. When a pregnant person catches chickenpox in the week before birth or within a couple of days after giving birth, the baby has a higher risk of getting a life-threatening infection.If you're pregnant and not immune to chickenpox, talk to your health care provider about these risks.If you've had chickenpox, you're at risk of a complication called shingles. The varicella-zoster virus stays in your nerve cells after the chickenpox rash goes away. Many years later, the virus can turn back on and cause shingles, a painful cluster of blisters. The virus is more likely to come back in older adults and people who have weaker immune systems.The pain of shingles can last long after the blisters go away, and it can be serious. This is called postherpetic neuralgia.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests you get the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, if you're 50 or older. The agency also suggests Shingrix if you're 19 or older and you have a weaker immune system because of diseases or treatments. Shingrix is recommended even if you've already had shingles or you've gotten the older shingles vaccine, Zostavax.Other shingles vaccines are offered outside of the United States. Talk to your provider for more information on how well they prevent shingles.The chickenpox vaccine, also called the varicella vaccine, is the best way to prevent chickenpox. In the United States, experts from the CDC report that two doses of the vaccine prevent illness over 90% of the time. Even if you get chickenpox after receiving the vaccine, your symptoms may be much milder.In the United States, two chickenpox vaccines are licensed for use: Varivax contains only the chickenpox vaccine. It can be used in the United States to vaccinate people age 1 or older. ProQuad combines the chickenpox vaccine with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. It can be used in the United States for children ages 1 to 12. This is also called the MMRV vaccine.In the United States, children receive two doses of the varicella vaccine: the first between ages 12 and 15 months and the second between ages 4 and 6 years. This is part of the routine vaccination schedule for children.For some children between the ages of 12 and 23 months, the MMRV combination vaccine may raise the risk of fever and seizure from the vaccine. Ask your child's health care provider about the pros and cons of using the combined vaccines.Children 7 to 12 years old who haven't been vaccinated should receive two doses of the varicella vaccine. The doses should be given at least three months apart.People age 13 or older who haven't been vaccinated should receive two catch-up doses of the vaccine at least four weeks apart. It's even more important to get the vaccine if you have a higher risk of getting exposed to chickenpox. This includes health care workers, teachers, child-care employees, international travelers, military personnel, adults who live with young children and all nonpregnant women of childbearing age.If you don't remember whether you've had chickenpox or the vaccine, your provider can give you a blood test to find out.Other chickenpox vaccines are offered outside the United States. Talk to your health care provider for more information on how well they prevent chickenpox.Do not get the chickenpox vaccine if you're pregnant. If you decide to get vaccinated before pregnancy, don't try to get pregnant during the series of shots or for one month after the last dose of the vaccine.Other people also shouldn't get the vaccine, or they should wait. Check with your health care provider about whether you should get the vaccine if you:
Have a weaker immune system. This includes people who have HIV or take medicines that have an effect on the immune system.
Are allergic to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin.
Have any kind of cancer or are getting cancer treatment with radiation or medicines.
Recently received blood from a donor or other blood products.
Talk to your provider if you're not sure whether you need the vaccine. If you plan on getting pregnant, ask your provider if you're up to date on your vaccines.Parents often wonder whether vaccines are safe. Since the chickenpox vaccine became available, studies have found that it's safe and it works well. Side effects are often mild. They include pain, redness, soreness and swelling at the site of the shot. Rarely, you might get a rash at the site or a fever.

Tingling and itching. Many people feel itching, burning or tingling around the lips for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blisters form.
Blisters. Small fluid-filled blisters often form along the border of the lips. Sometimes they appear around the nose or cheeks or inside the mouth.
Oozing and crusting. The small blisters may merge and then burst. This can leave shallow open sores that ooze and crust over.
Symptoms vary, depending on whether this is your first outbreak or a recurrence. The first time you have a cold sore, symptoms may not start for up to 20 days after you were first exposed to the virus. The sores can last several days. And the blisters can take 2 to 3 weeks to heal completely. If blisters return, they'll often appear at the same spot each time and tend to be less severe than the first outbreak.In a first-time outbreak, you also might experience:
Fever.
Painful gums.
Sore throat.
Headache.
Muscle aches.
Swollen lymph nodes.
Children under 5 years old may have cold sores inside their mouths. These sores are often mistaken for canker sores. Canker sores involve only the mucous membrane and aren't caused by the herpes simplex virus.Cold sores generally clear up without treatment. See your health care provider if:
You have a weak immune system.
The cold sores don't heal within two weeks.
Symptoms are severe.
The cold sores often return.
You have gritty or painful eyes.
Cold sores are caused by certain strains of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-1 usually causes cold sores. HSV-2 is often the cause of genital herpes. But either type can spread to the face or genitals through close contact, such as kissing or oral sex. Shared eating utensils, razors and towels can also spread HSV-1.Cold sores are most likely to spread when you have oozing blisters. But you can spread the virus even if you don't have blisters. Many people who are infected with the virus that causes cold sores never develop symptoms.Once you've had a herpes infection, the virus can hide in nerve cells in the skin and may cause another cold sore at the same place as before. A return of cold sores may be triggered by:
Viral infection or fever.
Hormonal changes, such as those related to a menstrual period.
Stress.
Fatigue.
Being in the sun or wind.
Changes in the immune system.
Injury to the skin.
Almost everyone is at risk of cold sores. Most adults carry the virus that causes cold sores, even if they've never had symptoms.You're most at risk of complications from the virus if you have a weak immune system from conditions and treatments such as:
HIV/AIDS.
Atopic dermatitis (eczema).
Cancer chemotherapy.
Anti-rejection medicine for organ transplants.
In some people, the virus that causes cold sores can cause problems in other areas of the body, including:
Fingertips. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be spread to the fingers. This type of infection is often referred to as herpes whitlow. Children who suck their thumbs may transfer the infection from their mouths to their thumbs.
Eyes. The virus can sometimes cause eye infection. Repeated infections can cause scarring and injury, which may lead to vision problems or loss of vision.
Widespread areas of skin. People who have a skin condition called atopic dermatitis (eczema) are at higher risk of cold sores spreading all across their bodies. This can become a medical emergency.
Your health care provider may prescribe an antiviral medicine for you to take on a regular basis if you develop cold sores more than nine times a year or if you're at high risk of serious complications. If sunlight seems to trigger your condition, apply sunblock to the spot where the cold sore tends to form. Or talk with your health care provider about using an oral antiviral medicine before you do an activity that tends to cause a cold sore to return.Take these steps to help avoid spreading cold sores to other people:
Avoid kissing and skin contact with people while blisters are present. The virus spreads most easily when the blisters leak fluid.
Avoid sharing items. Utensils, towels, lip balm and other personal items can spread the virus when blisters are present.
Keep your hands clean. When you have a cold sore, wash your hands carefully before touching yourself and other people, especially babies.

A thick, rough area of skin
A hardened, raised bump
Tenderness or pain under the skin
Flaky, dry or waxy skin
Corns and calluses are not the same thing.
Corns are smaller and deeper than calluses and have a hard center surrounded by swollen skin. They can be painful when pressed. Hard corns often form on the top of the toes or the outer edge of the small toe. Soft corns tend to form between the toes.
Calluses are rarely painful and tend to develop on pressure spots, such as the heels, the balls of the feet, the palms and the knees. They may vary in size and shape and are often larger than corns.
If a corn or callus becomes very painful or inflamed, see your health care provider. If you have diabetes or poor blood flow, seek medical care before self-treating a corn or callus. This is important because even a minor injury to your foot can lead to an infected open sore (ulcer).Corns and calluses are caused by friction and pressure from repeated actions. Some sources of this friction and pressure include:
Wearing ill-fitting shoes and socks. Tight shoes and high heels can squeeze areas of the feet. If your shoes are loose, your foot may repeatedly slide and rub against the shoe. Your foot may also rub against a seam or stitch inside the shoe. Socks that don't fit right can also be a problem. 
Skipping socks. Wearing shoes and sandals without socks can cause friction on your feet.
Playing instruments or using hand tools. Calluses on the hands may result from the repeated pressure of activities such as playing instruments and using hand tools or even a pen.
Inheriting a tendency to develop corns. The type of corn that forms on non-weight-bearing areas, such as the soles and palms (keratosis punctata), might be caused by genetics.
If you have diabetes or another condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet, you're at greater risk of complications from corns and calluses.These approaches may help you prevent corns and calluses:
Wear shoes that give your toes plenty of room. If you can't wiggle your toes, your shoes are too tight. Have a shoe shop stretch your shoes at any point that rubs or pinches. Shop for shoes when your feet are most swollen, usually at the end of the day. If you use orthotics and inserts, be sure to have them on while fitting your shoes at the store.
Use protective coverings. Wear felt pads, nonmedicated corn pads or bandages over areas that rub against your footwear. You can also try toe separators or some lamb's wool between your toes.
Wear padded gloves when using hand tools. Or try padding your tool handles with cloth tape or covers.

Small bumps or blisters around the genitals, anus or mouth
Painful ulcers that form when blisters rupture and ooze or bleed
Scabs that form as the ulcers heal
Painful urination
Discharge from the urethra, the tube that releases urine from the body

Rectum
Anus
Mouth
Urethra
Vulva
Vagina

After the first outbreak of genital herpes, symptoms often appear again. These are called recurrent outbreaks or recurrent episodes.How often recurrent outbreaks happen varies widely. You'll usually have the most outbreaks the first year after infection. They may appear less often over time. Your symptoms during recurrent outbreaks usually don't last as long and aren't as severe as the first.You may have warning signs a few hours or days before a new outbreak starts. These are called prodromal symptoms. They include:
Genital pain
Tingling or shooting pain in the legs, hips or buttocks
If you suspect you have genital herpes, or any other STI, see your health care provider.Genital herpes is caused by two types of herpes simplex virus. These types include herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). People with HSV infections can pass along the virus even when they have no visible symptoms.HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes. The virus can be present:
On blisters and ulcers or the fluid from ulcers
The moist lining or fluids of the mouth
The moist lining or fluids of the vagina or rectum
The virus moves from one person to another during sexual activity.HSV-1 is a version of the virus that causes cold sores or fever blisters. People may be exposed to HSV-1 as children due to close skin-to-skin contact with someone infected.A person with HSV-1 in tissues of the mouth can pass the virus to the genitals of a sexual partner during oral sex. The newly caught infection is a genital herpes infection.Recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes caused by HSV-1 are often less frequent than outbreaks caused by HSV-2.Neither HSV-1 nor HSV-2 survives well at room temperature. So the virus is not likely to spread through surfaces, such as a faucet handle or a towel. But kissing or sharing a drinking glass or silverware might spread the virus.A higher risk of getting genital herpes is linked to:
Contact with genitals through oral, vaginal or anal sex. Having sexual contact without using a barrier increases your risk of genital herpes. Barriers include condoms and condom-like protectors called dental dams used during oral sex. Women are at higher risk of getting genital herpes. The virus can spread more easily from men to women than from women to men.
Having sex with multiple partners. The number of people you have sex with is a strong risk factor. Contact with genitals through sex or sexual activity puts you at higher risk. Most people with genital herpes do not know they have it.
Having a partner who has the disease but is not taking medicine to treat it. There is no cure for genital herpes, but medicine can help limit outbreaks.
Certain groups within the population. Women, people with a history of sexually transmitted diseases, older people, Black people in in the United States and men who have sex with men diagnosed with genital herpes at a higher than average rate. People in groups at higher risk may choose to talk to a health care provider about their personal risk.
Complications associated with genital herpes may include:
Other sexually transmitted infections. Having genital sores raises your risk of giving or getting other STIs, including HIV/AIDS.
Newborn infection. A baby can be infected with HSV during delivery. Less often, the virus is passed during pregnancy or by close contact after delivery. Newborns with HSV often have infections of internal organs or the nervous system. Even with treatment, these newborns have a high risk of developmental or physical problems and a risk of death.
Internal inflammatory disease. HSV infection can cause swelling and inflammation within the organs associated with sexual activity and urination. These include the ureter, rectum, vagina, cervix and uterus.
Finger infection. An HSV infection can spread to a finger through a break in the skin causing discoloration, swelling and sores. The infections are called herpetic whitlow.
Eye infection. HSV infection of the eye can cause pain, sores, blurred vision and blindness.
Swelling of the brain. Rarely, HSV infection leads to inflammation and swelling of the brain, also called encephalitis.
Infection of internal organs. Rarely, HSV in the bloodstream can cause infections of internal organs.
Prevention of genital herpes is the same as preventing other sexually transmitted infections.
Have one long-term sexual partner who has been tested for STIs and isn't infected.
Use a condom or dental dam during sexual activity. These reduce the risk of disease, but they don't prevent all skin-to-skin contact during sex.
Don't have sex when a partner with genital herpes has symptoms.
If you are pregnant and know you have genital herpes, tell your health care provider. If you think you might have genital herpes, ask your provider if you can be tested for it.Your provider may recommend that you take herpes antiviral medicines late in pregnancy. This is to try to prevent an outbreak around the time of delivery. If you have an outbreak when you go into labor, your provider may suggest a cesarean section. That is a surgery to remove the baby from your uterus. It lowers the risk of passing the virus to your baby.

Tingling and itching. Many people feel itching, burning or tingling around the lips for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blisters form.
Blisters. Small fluid-filled blisters often form along the border of the lips. Sometimes they appear around the nose or cheeks or inside the mouth.
Oozing and crusting. The small blisters may merge and then burst. This can leave shallow open sores that ooze and crust over.
Symptoms vary, depending on whether this is your first outbreak or a recurrence. The first time you have a cold sore, symptoms may not start for up to 20 days after you were first exposed to the virus. The sores can last several days. And the blisters can take 2 to 3 weeks to heal completely. If blisters return, they'll often appear at the same spot each time and tend to be less severe than the first outbreak.In a first-time outbreak, you also might experience:
Fever.
Painful gums.
Sore throat.
Headache.
Muscle aches.
Swollen lymph nodes.
Children under 5 years old may have cold sores inside their mouths. These sores are often mistaken for canker sores. Canker sores involve only the mucous membrane and aren't caused by the herpes simplex virus.Cold sores generally clear up without treatment. See your health care provider if:
You have a weak immune system.
The cold sores don't heal within two weeks.
Symptoms are severe.
The cold sores often return.
You have gritty or painful eyes.
Cold sores are caused by certain strains of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-1 usually causes cold sores. HSV-2 is often the cause of genital herpes. But either type can spread to the face or genitals through close contact, such as kissing or oral sex. Shared eating utensils, razors and towels can also spread HSV-1.Cold sores are most likely to spread when you have oozing blisters. But you can spread the virus even if you don't have blisters. Many people who are infected with the virus that causes cold sores never develop symptoms.Once you've had a herpes infection, the virus can hide in nerve cells in the skin and may cause another cold sore at the same place as before. A return of cold sores may be triggered by:
Viral infection or fever.
Hormonal changes, such as those related to a menstrual period.
Stress.
Fatigue.
Being in the sun or wind.
Changes in the immune system.
Injury to the skin.
Almost everyone is at risk of cold sores. Most adults carry the virus that causes cold sores, even if they've never had symptoms.You're most at risk of complications from the virus if you have a weak immune system from conditions and treatments such as:
HIV/AIDS.
Atopic dermatitis (eczema).
Cancer chemotherapy.
Anti-rejection medicine for organ transplants.
In some people, the virus that causes cold sores can cause problems in other areas of the body, including:
Fingertips. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be spread to the fingers. This type of infection is often referred to as herpes whitlow. Children who suck their thumbs may transfer the infection from their mouths to their thumbs.
Eyes. The virus can sometimes cause eye infection. Repeated infections can cause scarring and injury, which may lead to vision problems or loss of vision.
Widespread areas of skin. People who have a skin condition called atopic dermatitis (eczema) are at higher risk of cold sores spreading all across their bodies. This can become a medical emergency.
Your health care provider may prescribe an antiviral medicine for you to take on a regular basis if you develop cold sores more than nine times a year or if you're at high risk of serious complications. If sunlight seems to trigger your condition, apply sunblock to the spot where the cold sore tends to form. Or talk with your health care provider about using an oral antiviral medicine before you do an activity that tends to cause a cold sore to return.Take these steps to help avoid spreading cold sores to other people:
Avoid kissing and skin contact with people while blisters are present. The virus spreads most easily when the blisters leak fluid.
Avoid sharing items. Utensils, towels, lip balm and other personal items can spread the virus when blisters are present.
Keep your hands clean. When you have a cold sore, wash your hands carefully before touching yourself and other people, especially babies.

However, the virus can be in your body from 7 to 19 days before you look or feel sick. This time is called the incubation period.After the incubation period, sudden flu-like symptoms occur. These include:
Fever
Muscle aches
Headache
Severe fatigue
Severe back pain
Vomiting, sometimes
A few days later, flat, red spots appear on the body. They may start in the mouth and on the tongue and then spread to the skin. The face, arms and legs are often affected first, followed by the torso, hands and feet.Within a day or two, many of the spots turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid. Later, the blisters fill with pus. These sores are called pustules. Scabs form 8 to 9 days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars.Smallpox can be spread from person to person when the rash appears and until the scabs fall off.Smallpox is caused by the variola virus. The virus can spread:
Directly from person to person. You can catch the smallpox virus by being around someone who has it. An infected person can spread the virus when they cough, sneeze or talk. Coming in contact with skin sores also can cause you to get smallpox.
Indirectly from an infected person. Rarely, smallpox can spread through the air inside buildings, infecting people in other rooms or on other floors.
Through contaminated items. Smallpox can also spread through contact with contaminated clothing and bedding. But getting smallpox this way is less likely.
As a terrorist weapon, potentially. Using smallpox as a weapon is an unlikely threat. But because releasing the virus could spread the disease quickly, governments are preparing for this possibility.
Most people who get smallpox survive. However, some rare types of smallpox are almost always deadly. These more-severe forms are most common in pregnant women and children.People who recover from smallpox usually have severe scars, especially on the face, arms and legs. Sometimes, smallpox causes vision loss (blindness).If a smallpox outbreak happened, people with smallpox would be isolated to try to stop the spread of the virus. Anyone who had contact with someone who had smallpox would need a smallpox vaccine. A vaccine can protect you from getting sick or cause you to get less sick if you get smallpox. The vaccine should be given before or one week after exposure to the virus.Two vaccines are available:

The ACAM2000 vaccine uses a live virus that's like smallpox, but less harmful. It can sometimes cause serious side effects, such as infections in the heart or brain. That's why the vaccine is not given to everyone. Unless there is a smallpox outbreak, the risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits for most people.
A second vaccine (Jynneos) uses a very weakened strain of virus and is safer than ACAM2000. It can be used in people who can't take ACAM2000 due to compromised immune systems or skin disorders.
Smallpox vaccines also provide protection against other similar viral infections such as mpox, also known as monkeypox, and cowpox.If you had the smallpox vaccine as a child, you have some level of protection against the smallpox virus. Full or partial immunity after a smallpox vaccine may last up to 10 years, and 20 years with booster shots. If an outbreak happened, people who got vaccinated as children would likely get a new vaccination if they were exposed to the virus.

The rash often lasts about 5 to 10 days. Other symptoms that may appear 1 to 2 days before the rash include:
Fever.
Loss of appetite.
Headache.
Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell.
Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases:
Raised bumps called papules, which break out over a few days.
Small fluid-filled blisters called vesicles, which form in about one day and then break and leak.
Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take a few more days to heal.
New bumps keep showing up for several days. So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears. And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over. The disease is by and large mild in healthy children. But sometimes, the rash can cover the whole body. Blisters may form in the throat and eyes. They also may form in tissue that lines the inside of the urethra, anus and vagina.If you think you or your child might have chickenpox, call your health care provider. Often, chickenpox can be diagnosed with an exam of the rash and other symptoms. You may need medicines that can help fight off the virus or treat other health problems that can happen because of chickenpox. To avoid infecting others in the waiting room, call ahead for an appointment. Mention that you think you or your child may have chickenpox.Also, let your provider know if:
The rash spreads to one or both eyes.
The rash gets very warm or tender. This might be a sign that the skin is infected with bacteria.
You have more serious symptoms along with the rash. Watch for dizziness, new confusion, fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, shakiness, loss of the ability to use muscles together, a cough that becomes worse, vomiting, stiff neck or a fever higher than 102 F (38.9 C).
You live with people who've never had chickenpox and haven't gotten the chickenpox vaccine yet.
Someone in your household is pregnant.
You live with someone who has a disease or takes medicines that affect the immune system.
A virus called varicella-zoster causes chickenpox. It can spread through direct contact with the rash. It also can spread when a person with chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you breathe in the air droplets.Your risk of getting infected with the virus that causes chickenpox is higher if you haven't already had chickenpox or if you haven't had the chickenpox vaccine. It's extra important for people who work in child care or school settings to be vaccinated.Most people who have had chickenpox or have gotten the vaccine are immune to chickenpox. If you've been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder. You may have fewer blisters and mild or no fever. A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare.Chickenpox is often a mild disease. But it can be serious and can lead to other health problem including:
Infected skin, soft tissues, bones, joints or bloodstream caused by bacteria.
Dehydration, when the body runs too low on water and other fluids.
Pneumonia, an illness in one or both lungs.
Swelling of the brain called encephalitis.
Toxic shock syndrome, a dangerous complication of some illnesses caused by bacteria.
Reye's syndrome, a disease that causes swelling in the brain and liver. This can happen in children and teens who take aspirin during chickenpox.
In very rare cases, chickenpox could lead to death.People who are at higher risk of chickenpox complications include:
Newborns and infants whose mothers never had chickenpox or the vaccine. This includes children under age 1, who have not yet had the vaccine.
Teens and adults.
Pregnant women who haven't had chickenpox.
People who smoke.
People with cancer or HIV who are taking medication that has an effect on the immune system.
People with a chronic condition, such as asthma, who take medicine that calms immune response. Or those who have had an organ transplant and take medicine to limit the immune system's action.
Low birth weight and limb problems are more common in babies born to women who are infected with chickenpox early in their pregnancies. When a pregnant person catches chickenpox in the week before birth or within a couple of days after giving birth, the baby has a higher risk of getting a life-threatening infection.If you're pregnant and not immune to chickenpox, talk to your health care provider about these risks.If you've had chickenpox, you're at risk of a complication called shingles. The varicella-zoster virus stays in your nerve cells after the chickenpox rash goes away. Many years later, the virus can turn back on and cause shingles, a painful cluster of blisters. The virus is more likely to come back in older adults and people who have weaker immune systems.The pain of shingles can last long after the blisters go away, and it can be serious. This is called postherpetic neuralgia.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests you get the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, if you're 50 or older. The agency also suggests Shingrix if you're 19 or older and you have a weaker immune system because of diseases or treatments. Shingrix is recommended even if you've already had shingles or you've gotten the older shingles vaccine, Zostavax.Other shingles vaccines are offered outside of the United States. Talk to your provider for more information on how well they prevent shingles.The chickenpox vaccine, also called the varicella vaccine, is the best way to prevent chickenpox. In the United States, experts from the CDC report that two doses of the vaccine prevent illness over 90% of the time. Even if you get chickenpox after receiving the vaccine, your symptoms may be much milder.In the United States, two chickenpox vaccines are licensed for use: Varivax contains only the chickenpox vaccine. It can be used in the United States to vaccinate people age 1 or older. ProQuad combines the chickenpox vaccine with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. It can be used in the United States for children ages 1 to 12. This is also called the MMRV vaccine.In the United States, children receive two doses of the varicella vaccine: the first between ages 12 and 15 months and the second between ages 4 and 6 years. This is part of the routine vaccination schedule for children.For some children between the ages of 12 and 23 months, the MMRV combination vaccine may raise the risk of fever and seizure from the vaccine. Ask your child's health care provider about the pros and cons of using the combined vaccines.Children 7 to 12 years old who haven't been vaccinated should receive two doses of the varicella vaccine. The doses should be given at least three months apart.People age 13 or older who haven't been vaccinated should receive two catch-up doses of the vaccine at least four weeks apart. It's even more important to get the vaccine if you have a higher risk of getting exposed to chickenpox. This includes health care workers, teachers, child-care employees, international travelers, military personnel, adults who live with young children and all nonpregnant women of childbearing age.If you don't remember whether you've had chickenpox or the vaccine, your provider can give you a blood test to find out.Other chickenpox vaccines are offered outside the United States. Talk to your health care provider for more information on how well they prevent chickenpox.Do not get the chickenpox vaccine if you're pregnant. If you decide to get vaccinated before pregnancy, don't try to get pregnant during the series of shots or for one month after the last dose of the vaccine.Other people also shouldn't get the vaccine, or they should wait. Check with your health care provider about whether you should get the vaccine if you:
Have a weaker immune system. This includes people who have HIV or take medicines that have an effect on the immune system.
Are allergic to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin.
Have any kind of cancer or are getting cancer treatment with radiation or medicines.
Recently received blood from a donor or other blood products.
Talk to your provider if you're not sure whether you need the vaccine. If you plan on getting pregnant, ask your provider if you're up to date on your vaccines.Parents often wonder whether vaccines are safe. Since the chickenpox vaccine became available, studies have found that it's safe and it works well. Side effects are often mild. They include pain, redness, soreness and swelling at the site of the shot. Rarely, you might get a rash at the site or a fever.

The growths are bothersome and interfere with activities
You aren't sure whether the growths are warts
You are an adult and numerous warts begin to appear, which may indicate the immune system is malfunctioning
Common warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus is quite common and has more than 150 types, but only a few cause warts on your hands. Some strains of HPV are acquired through sexual contact. Most forms, however, are spread by casual skin contact or through shared objects, such as towels or washcloths. The virus usually spreads through breaks in your skin, such as a hangnail or a scrape. Biting your nails also can cause warts to spread on your fingertips and around your nails.Each person's immune system responds to the HPV virus differently, so not everyone who comes in contact with HPV develops warts.People at higher risk of developing common warts include:
Children and young adults, because their bodies may not have built up immunity to the virus
People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or people who've had organ transplants
To reduce your risk of common warts:
Avoid direct contact with warts. This includes your own warts.
Don't pick at warts. Picking may spread the virus.
Don't use the same emery board, pumice stone or nail clipper on your warts as you use on your healthy skin and nails. Use a disposable emery board.
Don't bite your fingernails. Warts occur more often in skin that has been broken. Nibbling the skin around your fingernails opens the door for the virus.
Groom with care. And avoid brushing, clipping or shaving areas that have warts. If you must shave, use an electric razor.

A small, rough growth on the bottom of your foot, usually at the base of the toes or on the ball or heel
On brown and Black skin, the growth may be lighter than unaffected skin
Hard, thickened skin (callus) over a spot on the skin, where a wart has grown inward
Black pinpoints, which are small clotted blood vessels commonly called wart seeds
A cluster of growths on the sole of the foot (mosaic warts)
A growth that interrupts the normal lines and ridges in the skin of your foot
Pain or tenderness when walking or standing
See your health care provider for the growth on your foot if:
The growth is bleeding, painful or changes in shape or color
You've tried treating the wart, but it persists, multiplies or comes back after clearing for a time (recurs)
Your pain interferes with your activities
You also have diabetes or poor feeling in your feet
You also have a weak immune system because of immune-suppressing drugs, HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders
You aren't sure if the growth is a wart
Plantar warts are caused by an infection with HPV in the outer layer of skin on the soles of the feet. The warts develop when the virus enters through tiny cuts, breaks or weak spots on the bottom of the foot. If left untreated, warts can last from a few months to 2 years in children, and several years in in adults.HPV is very common, and more than 100 kinds of the virus exist. But only a few of them cause warts on the feet. Other types of HPV are more likely to cause warts on other areas of your skin or on mucous membranes.Each person's immune system responds differently to HPV. Not everyone who comes in contact with it develops warts. Even people in the same family react to the virus differently.The HPV strains that cause plantar warts aren't highly contagious. So the virus isn't easily spread by direct contact from one person to another. But it thrives in warm, moist places, so you might get the virus by walking barefoot around swimming pools or locker rooms. If the virus spreads from the first site of infection, more warts may grow.Anyone can develop plantar warts, but this type of wart is more likely to affect:
Children and teenagers
People with weak immune systems
People who have had plantar warts before
People who walk barefoot in areas where a wart-causing virus is common, such as locker rooms and swimming pools
When plantar warts cause pain, you may alter your normal posture or gait â€” perhaps without realizing it. Eventually, this change in how you stand, walk or run can cause muscle or joint discomfort.To help prevent plantar warts:
Avoid direct contact with warts. This includes your own warts. Wash your hands carefully after touching a wart.
Keep your feet clean and dry.
Wear sandals or other foot protection when walking around swimming pools, in locker rooms or in gym showers.
Don't pick at or scratch warts.
When using an emery board, pumice stone or nail clipper on your warts, choose one that you don't use on your healthy skin and nails.

The DNA mutations tell the cells to grow and multiply rapidly, creating many abnormal cells.In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the mutations cause too many abnormal T cells that attack the skin. T cells are part of your immune system, and they normally help your body fight germs. Doctors don't know why the cells attack the skin.

Frequent or severe infections
Losing weight without trying
Swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen
Easy bleeding or bruising
Recurrent nosebleeds
Tiny red spots in your skin (petechiae)
Excessive sweating, especially at night
Bone pain or tenderness
Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.Leukemia symptoms are often vague and not specific. You may overlook early leukemia symptoms because they may resemble symptoms of the flu and other common illnesses.Sometimes leukemia is discovered during blood tests for some other condition.Scientists don't understand the exact causes of leukemia. It seems to develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.In general, leukemia is thought to occur when some blood cells acquire changes (mutations) in their genetic material or DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. In leukemia, the mutations tell the blood cells to continue growing and dividing.When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. Over time, these abnormal cells can crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, leading to fewer healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, causing the signs and symptoms of leukemia.Doctors classify leukemia based on its speed of progression and the type of cells involved.The first type of classification is by how fast the leukemia progresses:
Acute leukemia. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are immature blood cells (blasts). They can't carry out their normal functions, and they multiply rapidly, so the disease worsens quickly. Acute leukemia requires aggressive, timely treatment.
Chronic leukemia. There are many types of chronic leukemias. Some produce too many cells and some cause too few cells to be produced. Chronic leukemia involves more-mature blood cells. These blood cells replicate or accumulate more slowly and can function normally for a period of time. Some forms of chronic leukemia initially produce no early symptoms and can go unnoticed or undiagnosed for years.
The second type of classification is by type of white blood cell affected:
Lymphocytic leukemia. This type of leukemia affects the lymphoid cells (lymphocytes), which form lymphoid or lymphatic tissue. Lymphatic tissue makes up your immune system.
Myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia. This type of leukemia affects the myeloid cells. Myeloid cells give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells and platelet-producing cells.
The major types of leukemia are:
Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). This is the most common type of leukemia in young children. ALL can also occur in adults.
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AML is a common type of leukemia. It occurs in children and adults. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). With CLL, the most common chronic adult leukemia, you may feel well for years without needing treatment.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This type of leukemia mainly affects adults. A person with CML may have few or no symptoms for months or years before entering a phase in which the leukemia cells grow more quickly.
Other types. Other, rarer types of leukemia exist, including hairy cell leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders.
Factors that may increase your risk of developing some types of leukemia include:
Previous cancer treatment. People who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other cancers have an increased risk of developing certain types of leukemia.
Genetic disorders. Genetic abnormalities seem to play a role in the development of leukemia. Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of leukemia.
Exposure to certain chemicals. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene â€” which is found in gasoline and is used by the chemical industry â€” is linked to an increased risk of some kinds of leukemia.
Smoking. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia.
Family history of leukemia. If members of your family have been diagnosed with leukemia, your risk of the disease may be increased.
However, most people with known risk factors don't get leukemia. And many people with leukemia have none of these risk factors.

It isn't usually painful and may go unnoticed for a while.Leukoplakia may appear:
White or grayish in patches that can't be wiped away
Irregular or flat-textured
Thickened or hardened in areas
Along with raised, red lesions (speckled leukoplakia or erythroplakia), which are more likely to show precancerous changes
Hairy leukoplakia causes fuzzy, white patches that resemble folds or ridges, usually on the sides of your tongue. It's often mistaken for oral thrush, an infection marked by creamy white patches that can be wiped away, which is also common in people with a weakened immune system.Even though leukoplakia doesn't usually cause discomfort, sometimes it can indicate a more serious condition.See your dentist or primary care professional if you have any of the following:
White plaques or sores in your mouth that don't heal on their own within two weeks
    
Lumps or white, red or dark patches in your mouth
    
Persistent changes in the tissues of your mouth
    
Ear pain when swallowing
    
Progressive reduction in the ability to open your jaw
    
Although the cause of leukoplakia is unknown, chronic irritation, such as from tobacco use, including smoking and chewing, appears to be responsible for most cases. Often, regular users of smokeless tobacco products eventually develop leukoplakia where they hold the tobacco against their cheeks.Other causes may include chronic irritation from:
Jagged, broken or sharp teeth rubbing on tongue surfaces
Broken or ill-fitting dentures
Long-term alcohol use
Your dentist can talk with you about what may be causing leukoplakia in your case.Hairy leukoplakia results from infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Once you've been infected with EBV, the virus remains in your body for life. Normally, the virus is dormant, but if your immune system is weakened, especially from HIV/AIDS, the virus can become reactivated, leading to conditions such as hairy leukoplakia.Tobacco use, particularly smokeless tobacco, puts you at high risk of leukoplakia and oral cancer. Long-term alcohol use increases your risk, and drinking alcohol combined with smoking increases your risk even more.People with HIV/AIDS are especially likely to develop hairy leukoplakia. Although the use of antiretroviral drugs has reduced the number of cases, hairy leukoplakia still affects a number of HIV-positive people, and it may be one of the first signs of HIV infection.Leukoplakia usually doesn't cause permanent damage to tissues in your mouth. However, leukoplakia increases your risk of oral cancer. Oral cancers often form near leukoplakia patches, and the patches themselves may show cancerous changes. Even after leukoplakia patches are removed, the risk of oral cancer remains.Hairy leukoplakia isn't likely to lead to cancer. But it may indicate HIV/AIDS.You may be able to prevent leukoplakia if you avoid all tobacco products or alcohol use. Talk to your doctor about methods to help you quit. If you continue to smoke or chew tobacco or drink alcohol, have frequent dental checkups. Oral cancers are usually painless until fairly advanced, so quitting tobacco and alcohol is a better prevention strategy.If you have a weakened immune system, you may not be able to prevent hairy leukoplakia, but identifying it early can help you receive appropriate treatment.

But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day â€” your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area.Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. When melanoma occurs in people with dark skin tones, it's more likely to occur in areas not normally exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your neck or face.Basal cell carcinoma may appear as:
A pearly or waxy bump
A flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion
A bleeding or scabbing sore that heals and returns
Most often, squamous cell carcinoma occurs on sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your face, ears and hands. People with darker skin are more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that aren't often exposed to the sun.Squamous cell carcinoma may appear as:
A firm, red nodule
A flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface
Melanoma can develop anywhere on your body, in otherwise normal skin or in an existing mole that becomes cancerous. Melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men. In women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs. In both men and women, melanoma can occur on skin that hasn't been exposed to the sun.Melanoma can affect people of any skin tone. In people with darker skin tones, melanoma tends to occur on the palms or soles, or under the fingernails or toenails.Melanoma signs include:
A large brownish spot with darker speckles
A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds
A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black
A painful lesion that itches or burns
Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus
Other, less common types of skin cancer include:
Kaposi sarcoma. This rare form of skin cancer develops in the skin's blood vessels and causes red or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes.
Kaposi sarcoma mainly occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as people with AIDS, and in people taking medications that suppress their natural immunity, such as people who've undergone organ transplants.
Other people with an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma include young men living in Africa or older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish heritage.

Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma causes firm, shiny nodules that occur on or just beneath the skin and in hair follicles. Merkel cell carcinoma is most often found on the head, neck and trunk.
Sebaceous gland carcinoma. This uncommon and aggressive cancer originates in the oil glands in the skin. Sebaceous gland carcinomas â€” which usually appear as hard, painless nodules â€” can develop anywhere, but most occur on the eyelid, where they're frequently mistaken for other eyelid problems.
Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any changes to your skin that worry you. Not all skin changes are caused by skin cancer. Your doctor will investigate your skin changes to determine a cause.Skin cancer occurs when errors (mutations) occur in the DNA of skin cells. The mutations cause the cells to grow out of control and form a mass of cancer cells.Skin cancer begins in your skin's top layer â€” the epidermis. The epidermis is a thin layer that provides a protective cover of skin cells that your body continually sheds. The epidermis contains three main types of cells:
Squamous cells lie just below the outer surface and function as the skin's inner lining.
Basal cells, which produce new skin cells, sit beneath the squamous cells.
Melanocytes â€” which produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its normal color â€” are located in the lower part of your epidermis. Melanocytes produce more melanin when you're in the sun to help protect the deeper layers of your skin.
Where your skin cancer begins determines its type and your treatment options.Much of the damage to DNA in skin cells results from ultraviolet (UV) radiation found in sunlight and in the lights used in tanning beds. But sun exposure doesn't explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of skin cancer, such as being exposed to toxic substances or having a condition that weakens your immune system.Factors that may increase your risk of skin cancer include:
Fair skin. Anyone, regardless of skin color, can get skin cancer. However, having less pigment (melanin) in your skin provides less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair and light-colored eyes, and you freckle or sunburn easily, you're much more likely to develop skin cancer than is a person with darker skin.
A history of sunburns. Having had one or more blistering sunburns as a child or teenager increases your risk of developing skin cancer as an adult. Sunburns in adulthood also are a risk factor.
Excessive sun exposure. Anyone who spends considerable time in the sun may develop skin cancer, especially if the skin isn't protected by sunscreen or clothing. Tanning, including exposure to tanning lamps and beds, also puts you at risk. A tan is your skin's injury response to excessive UV radiation.
Sunny or high-altitude climates. People who live in sunny, warm climates are exposed to more sunlight than are people who live in colder climates. Living at higher elevations, where the sunlight is strongest, also exposes you to more radiation.
Moles. People who have many moles or abnormal moles called dysplastic nevi are at increased risk of skin cancer. These abnormal moles â€” which look irregular and are generally larger than normal moles â€” are more likely than others to become cancerous. If you have a history of abnormal moles, watch them regularly for changes.
Precancerous skin lesions. Having skin lesions known as actinic keratoses can increase your risk of developing skin cancer. These precancerous skin growths typically appear as rough, scaly patches that range in color from brown to dark pink. They're most common on the face, head and hands of fair-skinned people whose skin has been sun damaged.
A family history of skin cancer. If one of your parents or a sibling has had skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of the disease.
A personal history of skin cancer. If you developed skin cancer once, you're at risk of developing it again.
A weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have a greater risk of developing skin cancer. This includes people living with HIV/AIDS and those taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant.
Exposure to radiation. People who received radiation treatment for skin conditions such as eczema and acne may have an increased risk of skin cancer, particularly basal cell carcinoma.
Exposure to certain substances. Exposure to certain substances, such as arsenic, may increase your risk of skin cancer.
Most skin cancers are preventable. To protect yourself, follow these skin cancer prevention tips:
Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy.
You absorb UV radiation year-round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays. Avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer.

Wear sunscreen year-round. Sunscreens don't filter out all harmful UV radiation, especially the radiation that can lead to melanoma. But they play a major role in an overall sun protection program.
Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours â€” or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. Use a generous amount of sunscreen on all exposed skin, including your lips, the tips of your ears, and the backs of your hands and neck.

Wear protective clothing. Sunscreens don't provide complete protection from UV rays. So cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than a baseball cap or visor does.
Some companies also sell photoprotective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand.
Don't forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV radiation â€” UVA and UVB rays.

Avoid tanning beds. Lights used in tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer.
Be aware of sun-sensitizing medications. Some common prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including antibiotics, can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the side effects of any medications you take. If they increase your sensitivity to sunlight, take extra precautions to stay out of the sun in order to protect your skin.

Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor. Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks.
With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine your chest and trunk, and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Examine both the front and back of your legs, and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.

They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face.Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin.The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:
A change in an existing mole
The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin
Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin.Normal moles are generally a uniform color â€” such as tan, brown or black â€” with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter â€” the size of a pencil eraser.Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age.To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE:
A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves.
B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders â€” characteristics of melanomas.
C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color.
D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).
E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding.
Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area.Hidden melanomas include:
Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment.
Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions.
Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea â€” the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera). An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.
Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any skin changes that seem unusual.Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells (melanocytes) that give color to your skin.Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way â€” healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin's surface, where they die and eventually fall off. But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells.Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn't clear. It's likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma. Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma.UV light doesn't cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don't receive exposure to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.Factors that may increase your risk of melanoma include:
Fair skin. Having less pigment (melanin) in your skin means you have less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you're more likely to develop melanoma than is someone with a darker complexion. But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people.
A history of sunburn. One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma.
Excessive ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma.
Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. People living closer to the earth's equator, where the sun's rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south. In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you're exposed to more UV radiation.
Having many moles or unusual moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors.
A family history of melanoma. If a close relative â€” such as a parent, child or sibling â€” has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too.
Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Your immune system may be impaired if you take medicine to suppress the immune system, such as after an organ transplant, or if you have a disease that impairs the immune system, such as AIDS.
You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you:

Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy.

But moles come in different colors, shapes and sizes:
Color and texture. Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink. They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them.
Shape. Most moles are oval or round.
Size. Moles are usually less than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter â€” the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth (congenital nevi) can be bigger than usual, covering part of the face, torso or a limb.
Moles can develop anywhere on your body, including your scalp, armpits, under your nails, and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 40 moles. Many of these develop by age 50. Moles may change or fade away over time. With hormonal changes in adolescence and pregnancy, they may become darker and larger.Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are sometimes called flesh moles, but they are actually dermatoses papulosa nigra â€” a type of seborrheic keratosis, not clusters of pigment-forming cells (nevi). Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. Flesh moles don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated if you consider them a cosmetic concern.A mole may be a sign of skin cancer if it has irregular borders or an asymmetrical shape or if it changes in color, shape, size or height. This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for:
A is for asymmetrical shape. One half is unlike the other half.
B is for border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders.
C is for color. Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color.
D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).
E is for evolving. Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding.
Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above. Others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.
Make an appointment with your doctor if a mole looks unusual, grows or otherwise changes.Moles are caused when cells in the skin called melanocytes grow in clusters. Melanocytes are generally distributed throughout the skin. They produce melanin, the natural pigment that gives skin its color.Melanoma is the main complication of moles. Some people have higher-than-average risk of their moles becoming cancerous and developing into melanoma. Factors that increase melanoma risk include:
Being born with large moles. These types of moles are called congenital nevi. On an infant, such moles are classified as large if they're more than 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter. Even a large mole seldom becomes cancerous.
Having unusual moles. Moles that are large and irregular in shape are known as atypical (dysplastic) nevi. They tend to run in families.
Having many moles. Having more than 50 moles indicates an increased risk of melanoma and possibly breast cancer.
Having a personal or family history of melanoma. If you've had melanoma before, you are at increased risk of a mole becoming cancerous. In addition, some types of atypical nevi lead to a genetic form of melanoma.
The following measures can help limit the development of moles and the main complication of moles â€” melanoma.Become familiar with the location and pattern of your moles. Regularly examine your skin to look for changes that may signal melanoma. Do self-exams of the skin once a month. With the help of mirrors, do a head-to-toe check, including your scalp, palms and fingernails, armpits, chest, legs, and feet, including the soles and the spaces between the toes. Also check the genital area and between the buttocks.Talk with your doctor about your risk factors for melanoma and whether you need a professional skin exam on a routine basis.Take measures to protect your skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, such as from the sun or tanning beds. UV radiation has been linked to increased melanoma risk. And children who haven't been protected from sun exposure tend to develop more moles.
Avoid peak sun times. For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Try to schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even on cloudy days or in winter. When you are outdoors, seek shade or use a sun-protective umbrella.
Use sunscreen year-round. Apply sunscreen about 30 minutes before going outdoors, even on cloudy days. Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Apply it generously and reapply every two hours â€” or more often if you're swimming or sweating. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.
Cover up. Sunglasses, broad-brimmed hats, long sleeves and other protective clothing can help you avoid damaging UV rays. You might also want to consider clothing that's made with fabric specially treated to block UV radiation.
Avoid tanning lamps and beds. Tanning lamps and beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer.

Avoid peak sun times. For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Try to schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even on cloudy days or in winter. When you are outdoors, seek shade or use a sun-protective umbrella.
Use sunscreen year-round. Apply sunscreen about 30 minutes before going outdoors, even on cloudy days. Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Apply it generously and reapply every two hours â€” or more often if you're swimming or sweating. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.
Cover up. Sunglasses, broad-brimmed hats, long sleeves and other protective clothing can help you avoid damaging UV rays. You might also want to consider clothing that's made with fabric specially treated to block UV radiation.
Avoid tanning lamps and beds. Tanning lamps and beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer.

But moles come in different colors, shapes and sizes:
Color and texture. Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink. They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them.
Shape. Most moles are oval or round.
Size. Moles are usually less than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter â€” the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth (congenital nevi) can be bigger than usual, covering part of the face, torso or a limb.
Moles can develop anywhere on your body, including your scalp, armpits, under your nails, and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 40 moles. Many of these develop by age 50. Moles may change or fade away over time. With hormonal changes in adolescence and pregnancy, they may become darker and larger.Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are sometimes called flesh moles, but they are actually dermatoses papulosa nigra â€” a type of seborrheic keratosis, not clusters of pigment-forming cells (nevi). Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. Flesh moles don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated if you consider them a cosmetic concern.A mole may be a sign of skin cancer if it has irregular borders or an asymmetrical shape or if it changes in color, shape, size or height. This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for:
A is for asymmetrical shape. One half is unlike the other half.
B is for border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders.
C is for color. Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color.
D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).
E is for evolving. Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding.
Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above. Others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.
Make an appointment with your doctor if a mole looks unusual, grows or otherwise changes.Moles are caused when cells in the skin called melanocytes grow in clusters. Melanocytes are generally distributed throughout the skin. They produce melanin, the natural pigment that gives skin its color.Melanoma is the main complication of moles. Some people have higher-than-average risk of their moles becoming cancerous and developing into melanoma. Factors that increase melanoma risk include:
Being born with large moles. These types of moles are called congenital nevi. On an infant, such moles are classified as large if they're more than 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter. Even a large mole seldom becomes cancerous.
Having unusual moles. Moles that are large and irregular in shape are known as atypical (dysplastic) nevi. They tend to run in families.
Having many moles. Having more than 50 moles indicates an increased risk of melanoma and possibly breast cancer.
Having a personal or family history of melanoma. If you've had melanoma before, you are at increased risk of a mole becoming cancerous. In addition, some types of atypical nevi lead to a genetic form of melanoma.
The following measures can help limit the development of moles and the main complication of moles â€” melanoma.Become familiar with the location and pattern of your moles. Regularly examine your skin to look for changes that may signal melanoma. Do self-exams of the skin once a month. With the help of mirrors, do a head-to-toe check, including your scalp, palms and fingernails, armpits, chest, legs, and feet, including the soles and the spaces between the toes. Also check the genital area and between the buttocks.Talk with your doctor about your risk factors for melanoma and whether you need a professional skin exam on a routine basis.Take measures to protect your skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, such as from the sun or tanning beds.

Fever
Headache
Fatigue
Weight loss
General aches and pains
Other signs and symptoms are related to the parts of the body affected, including:
Digestive system. If your stomach or intestines are affected, you may experience pain after eating. Ulcers and perforations are possible and may result in blood in the stool.
Ears. Dizziness, ringing in the ears and abrupt hearing loss may occur.
Eyes. Vasculitis can make your eyes look red and itch or burn. Giant cell arteritis can cause double vision and temporary or permanent blindness in one or both eyes. This is sometimes the first sign of the disease.
Hands or feet. Some types of vasculitis can cause numbness or weakness in a hand or foot. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet might swell or harden.
Lungs. You may develop shortness of breath or even cough up blood if vasculitis affects your lungs.
Skin. Bleeding under the skin can show up as red spots. Vasculitis can also cause lumps or open sores on your skin.
Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. Some types of vasculitis can worsen quickly, so early diagnosis is the key to getting effective treatment.The exact cause of vasculitis isn't fully understood. Some types are related to a person's genetic makeup. Others result from the immune system attacking blood vessel cells by mistake. Possible triggers for this immune system reaction include:
Infections, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C
Blood cancers
Immune system diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and scleroderma
Reactions to certain drugs
Vasculitis can happen to anyone. Factors that may increase the risk of certain disorders include:
Age. Giant cell arteritis rarely occurs before the age of 50, while Kawasaki disease is most common in children younger than 5 years old.
Family history. Behcet's disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Kawasaki disease sometimes run in families.
Lifestyle choices. Using cocaine can increase your risk of developing vasculitis. Smoking tobacco, especially if you're a man younger than 45, can increase your risk of Buerger's disease.
Medications. Vasculitis can sometimes be triggered by medications such as hydralazine, allopurinol, minocycline and propylthiouracil.
Infections. Having hepatitis B or C can increase your risk of vasculitis.
Immune disorders. People who have disorders in which their immune systems mistakenly attack their own bodies may be at higher risk of vasculitis. Examples include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.
Sex. Giant cell arteritis is much more common in women, while Buerger's disease is more common in men.
Vasculitis complications depend on the type and severity of your condition. Or they may be related to side effects of the prescription medications you use to treat the condition. Complications of vasculitis include:
Organ damage. Some types of vasculitis can be severe, causing damage to major organs.
Blood clots and aneurysms. A blood clot may form in a blood vessel, obstructing blood flow. Rarely, vasculitis will cause a blood vessel to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um).
Vision loss or blindness. This is a possible complication of untreated giant cell arteritis.
Infections. Some of the medications used to treat vasculitis may weaken your immune system. This can make you more prone to infections.

The first warning signs usually involve your sinuses, throat or lungs. The condition often worsens rapidly, affecting blood vessels and the organs they supply, such as the kidneys.Signs and symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis might include:
Pus-like drainage with crusts from your nose, stuffiness, sinus infections and nosebleeds
Coughing, sometimes with bloody phlegm
Shortness of breath or wheezing
Fever
Fatigue
Joint pain
Numbness in your limbs, fingers or toes
Weight loss
Blood in your urine
Skin sores, bruising or rashes
Eye redness, burning or pain, and vision problems
Ear inflammation and hearing problems
For some people, the disease affects only the lungs. When the kidneys are affected, blood and urine tests can detect the problem. Without treatment, kidney or lung failure can occur.See your doctor if you have a runny nose that doesn't respond to over-the-counter cold medicines, especially if it's accompanied by nosebleeds and pus-like material, coughing up blood, or other warning signs of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Because this disease can worsen quickly, early diagnosis is key to getting effective treatment.The cause of granulomatosis with polyangiitis isn't known. It's not contagious, and there's no evidence that it's inherited.The condition can lead to inflamed, narrowed blood vessels and harmful inflammatory tissue masses (granulomas). Granulomas can destroy normal tissue, and narrowed blood vessels reduce the amount of blood and oxygen that reaches your body's tissues and organs.Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can occur at any age. It most often affects people between the ages of 40 and 65.Besides affecting your nose, sinuses, throat, lungs and kidneys, granulomatosis with polyangiitis can affect your skin, eyes, ears, heart and other organs. Complications might include:
Hearing loss
Skin scarring
Kidney damage
A loss of height in the bridge of the nose (saddling) caused by weakened cartilage
A blood clot forming in one or more deep veins, usually in your leg

Rash (purpura). Reddish-purple spots that look like bruises develop on the buttocks, legs and feet. The rash can also appear on the arms, face and trunk and may be worse in areas of pressure, such as the sock line and waistline.
Swollen, sore joints (arthritis). People with Henoch-Schonlein purpura often have pain and swelling around the joints â€” mainly in the knees and ankles. Joint pain sometimes precedes the classical rash by one or two weeks. These symptoms subside when the disease clears and leave no lasting damage.
Digestive tract symptoms. Many children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura develop belly pain, nausea, vomiting and bloody stools. These symptoms sometimes occur before the rash appears.
Kidney involvement. Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also affect the kidneys. In most cases, this shows up as protein or blood in the urine, which you may not even know is there unless you have a urine test done. Usually this goes away once the illness passes, but some people develop persistent kidney disease.

If you have several ulcers, they may grow and merge into one larger ulcer.Talk to your doctor if you develop a painful, rapidly growing skin wound.The exact cause of pyoderma gangrenosum is unknown. The condition is not infectious or contagious. It's often associated with autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and arthritis. And it may have a genetic component.If you have pyoderma gangrenosum, new skin trauma, such as a cut or puncture wound, may trigger new ulcers.Certain factors may increase your risk of pyoderma gangrenosum, including:
Your age and sex. The condition can affect anyone at any age, though it's more common between 20 and 50 years of age.
Having inflammatory bowel disease. People with a digestive tract disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Having arthritis. People with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Having a blood disorder. People with acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplasia or a myeloproliferative disorder are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Possible complications of pyoderma gangrenosum include infection, scarring, uncontrolled pain, depression and loss of mobility.You can't totally prevent pyoderma gangrenosum. If you have the condition, try to avoid injuring your skin. Injury or trauma to your skin, including from surgery, can provoke new ulcers to form.

Raised, inflamed lines where you scratched.
Welts from friction.
Swelling.
Itching.
The symptoms may occur within a few minutes of the skin being rubbed or scratched. They tend to go away within 30 minutes. Rarely, the skin symptoms develop more slowly and lasts several hours to days. The condition itself can last for months or years.See your health care provider if your symptoms bother you.The exact cause of dermatographia isn't clear. It may be an allergic reaction, though no specific allergen has been found.Simple things may cause symptoms of dermatographia. For example, rubbing from your clothes or bedsheets may irritate your skin. In some people, the symptoms are preceded by an infection, emotional stress, vibration, cold exposure or taking a medicine.Dermatographia can occur at any age. It tends to be more common in teens and young adults. If you have other skin conditions, you may be at greater risk. One such condition is atopic dermatitis (eczema).Try these tips to reduce discomfort and prevent the symptoms of dermatographia:
Treat skin gently. Use a mild soap or nonsoap cleanser and pat skin dry. Wear things made of cloth that doesn't itch. Use warm water when you take a bath or shower.
Don't scratch your skin. Try not to scratch. This is a good tip for any skin condition.
Keep your skin moisturized. Use creams, lotions or ointments daily. Creams and ointments are thicker and tend to work better than lotions do. Apply your skin product while your skin is still damp from washing. Use it again during the day as needed.

The itch may develop hours or days after wearing a helmet or getting a close-shave haircut.A rash of small bumps appears on your neck, back of your head, or both. These often-itchy bumps can be mistaken for pimples or razor bumps. Scratching or combing where you have bumps can cause an infection, so you may also see pus-filled bumps.Without proper treatment, AKN can worsen. If this happens, existing bumps grow and new bumps appear. Growing bumps can be painful. Some bumps may bleed.In time, the bumps become small scars that can grow together and create a large, raised scar. This raised scar can be painful, and often becomes more painful as it grows.Where scars develop, youâ€™ll see hair loss. Most people develop a large, raised scar that spans their entire hairline. Scars can also appear in patches. Near the edge of the scars, ingrown hairs or tufted hairs can develop. Tufted hairs occur when several hairs grow out of one hair follicle (the opening in the skin from which a hair grows).Without medical care, AKN can continue to worsen. Some people develop swollen areas under their skin that contain pus. Called abscesses, these areas can grow together and form tunnels under the skin. The tunnels are called sinus tracts.

The lesion may also bleed or ulcerate when its surface breaks down. If it affects the lower legs, swelling of the leg can also occur. KS can affect internal organs like the lungs, liver, and intestines, but this is less common than KS that affects the skin. When this happens, there are often no visible signs or symptoms. However, depending on the location and size, you may experience bleeding if your lungs or gastrointestinal tract is involved. Shortness of breath can also occur. Another area that may develop KS is the lining of the inner mouth. Any one of these symptoms is a reason to seek medical attention.Even though it often progresses slowly, KS can ultimately be fatal. You should always seek treatment for KS.The forms of KS that appear in men and young children who live in tropical Africa are the most serious. If they're left untreated, these forms can result in death within a few years.Because indolent KS appears in older people and takes many years to develop and grow, many people die of another condition before their KS becomes serious enough to be fatal.AIDS-related KS is usually treatable and not a cause of death by itself.",,

It gradually becomes white or yellow in color toward the center of the oval.The exact symptoms and the severity of those symptoms depends on the type of morphea:This is the most common type. People with plaque-type morphea have three or four oval lesions. The lesions are painless, but might itch.This involves multiple widespread lesions that are larger. Generalized morphea can affect deeper tissues, which might lead to disfigurement. The lesions can also join together.This is a rapidly progressive type of morphea with many plaques that can cover almost your entire body. It spares hands and feet. This type needs the most aggressive treatment.Linear morphea features a single band of thickened, discolored skin. Usually, the indented band runs down an arm or leg, but it might also extend down your forehead. This is referred to as en coup de sabre because it makes the skin look as though itâ€™s been struck by a sword.Linear morphea is the most common type of morphea found in school-aged children. The lesions may extend to the tissue under their skin, even to their muscles and bones, leading to deformities. If linear morphea occurs on their face, it might cause issues with their eyes or alignment of their teeth.",,

These symptoms are often symmetric and affect the lower extremities more frequently than the upper extremities. Symptoms may also affect the ears and face. For secondary erythromelalgia, attacks typically precede and are precipitated by the underlying primary condition. For primary erythromelalgia, attacks can last from an hour to months at a time and occur infrequently to frequently with multiple times daily. Attacks most frequently occur at night, thus having the potential to greatly interfere with sleep. Common triggers for daytime episodes are exertion, heating of the affected extremities, and alcohol or caffeine consumption, and any pressure applied to the limbs. In some patients sugar and even melon consumption have also been known to provoke attacks. Many of those with primary erythromelalgia avoid wearing shoes or socks as the heat this generates is known to produce erythromelalgia attacks.[9] The coexistence of erythromelalgia and Raynaud's phenomenon is rare, but case studies of patients with both diagnoses have been reported in medical journals.[21] Symptoms may present gradually and incrementally, sometimes taking years to become intense enough for patients to seek medical care.

Very rarely do rheumatoid nodules occur as rheumatoid nodulosis (multiple nodules on the hands or other areas) in the absence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules can also appear in areas of the body other than the skin. Less commonly they occur in the lining of the lungs or other internal organs. The occurrence of nodules in the lungs of miners exposed to silica dust was known as Caplanâ€™s syndrome.[2] Rarely, the nodules occur at diverse sites on body (e.g., upper eyelid, distal region of the soles of the feet, vulva, and internally in the gallbladder, lung, heart valves, larynx, and spine).[3]

Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[17][18] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.

The original theory was that the hot petrolatum would travel down to the hair root, burn the follicle, and after repetitive injury scarring would result.[1] Later CCCA was realized to affect men and women without a history significant for use of such styling techniques. Consequently, the terms ""follicular degeneration syndrome"" per Sperling and Sau in 1992 and then CCCA per Olsent et al. in 2003 were evolved.

In some cases, the lesion may be confined to the mucosa of the lips, and in other cases the lesion may extend past the vermilion border (the edge where the lining on the lips becomes the skin on the face) onto the facial skin. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness).[2] Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth.[2][4] The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied.[2][4] There is not usually any bleeding.[7] Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin.[4] If Staphylococcus aureus is involved, the lesion may show golden yellow crusts.[8] In chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue.[2][4]

If there is doubt about the diagnosis, rubbing the area causes the skin around the lesion to become red while the lesion itself does not change in color.[3] Often the patches are difficult to see against the background color of the patientâ€™s skin, but if sunburn develops, then the white area stands out prominently.[4] The involved area is lighter than the normal skin, not because of a loss of pigment occurs, but because blood vessels are constricted, producing a permanent blanching of the area. This blanching is a functional rather than a structural abnormality, presumed to be caused by local increased sensitivity to catecholamines.[5] Although the cutaneous vasculature appears normal histologically, the blood vessels within the nevus do not respond to injection of vasodilators. It has been postulated that the persistent pallor may represent a sustained localized adrenergic vasoconstriction.[6] Results of a skin biopsy would be interpreted as normal and only physiological testing can reveal the nevus in contrast to normal skin. Stroking the patch elicits no red flare. Only the normal skin would react with a characteristic erythematous response. Examination under a Wood lamp can also reveal the nevus anemicus patch will not emphasize as a patch of vitiligo would.

Seek emergency care if you feel your tongue, lips, mouth or throat swelling or if you're having trouble breathing.For most people who experience acute hives and angioedema, the exact cause can't be identified. The conditions are sometimes caused by:
Foods. Many foods can trigger reactions in people with sensitivities. Shellfish, fish, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, eggs and milk are frequent offenders.
Medications. Many medications may cause hives or angioedema, including penicillins, aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) and blood pressure medications.
Airborne allergens. Pollen and other allergens that you breathe in can trigger hives, sometimes accompanied by upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms.
Insect bites and infections. Other causes of acute hives and angioedema are insect bites and infections.
Hives and angioedema are common. You may be at increased risk of hives and angioedema if you:
Have had hives or angioedema before
Have had other allergic reactions
Have a family history of hives, angioedema or hereditary angioedema
Severe angioedema can be life-threatening if swelling of the tongue or in the throat blocks the airway.To lower your likelihood of experiencing hives or angioedema, take the following precautions:
Avoid known triggers. If you know what has triggered your hives, try to avoid that substance.
Bathe and change your clothes. If pollen or animal contact has triggered your hives in the past, take a bath or shower and change your clothes if you're exposed to pollen or animals.

Occurs in a spot that's constantly irritated

Is in an unusual location, such as a finger and toe
The surface of your skin (epidermis) is made up of a thin, protective layer of cells that your body continuously sheds. Most epidermoid cysts form when these cells move deeper into your skin and multiply rather than slough off. Sometimes the cysts form due to irritation or injury of the skin or the most superficial portion of a hair follicle.The epidermal cells form the walls of the cyst and then secrete the protein keratin into the interior. The keratin is the thick, yellow substance that sometimes drains from the cyst. This abnormal growth of cells may be due to a damaged hair follicle or oil gland in your skin.Many people refer to epidermoid cysts as sebaceous cysts, but they're different. True sebaceous cysts are less common. They arise from the glands that secrete oily matter that lubricates hair and skin (sebaceous glands).Nearly anyone can develop one or more epidermoid cysts, but these factors make you more susceptible:
Being past puberty
Having certain rare genetic disorders
Injuring the skin
Potential complications of epidermoid cysts include:
Inflammation. An epidermoid cyst can become tender and swollen, even if it's not infected. An inflamed cyst is difficult to remove. Your doctor is likely to postpone removing it until the inflammation subsides.
Rupture. A ruptured cyst often leads to a boil-like infection that requires prompt treatment.
Infection. Cysts can become infected and painful (abscessed).
Skin cancer. In very rare cases, epidermoid cysts can lead to skin cancer.

The following pictures show what you may see on your skin.The is often the first sign. The tiny bumps and blister-like sores may appear after you injure your skin. For example, a scrape on the back of one knee could trigger nummular eczema bumps on the backs of both knees.The tiny bumps will crust over and join together. This causes the coin-shaped spots that this type of eczema was named for. Nummular means resembling a coin, and these round to oval-shaped spots can look like imperfectly shaped coins.If you have a darker skin tone, you may see brown spots. The spots can also appear lighter than your natural skin color. On lighter skin tones, the spots are pink or red. Regardless of color, these raised (and often scaly) spots can last for weeks or months.The spots can be intensely itchy. This itch tends to worsen when you relax or try to sleep. Some people say the skin with nummular eczema burns or stings. The skin between the spots is often extremely dry. Scratching the intensely itchy spots can cause raw, open skin. If germs from your hands spread to the open and raw skin, you may develop an infection. Signs of an infection include yellow or golden crusts on the spots of nummular eczema.An infection can start on skin with or without nummular eczema. Look for yellow or golden crusts, streaks of red (light skin) or brown (dark skin), swelling, or pus. Infected areas may feel tender or painful.As the spots start to clear, they flatten out. The center of the spot may clear first, as shown here.After a spot clears, you may see a flat spot of discolored skin. The flat spot that appears when nummular eczema clears is a skin reaction. Itâ€™s not nummular eczema. Most people who develop skin discoloration have darker skin tones.Some people continue to get nummular eczema. When this happens, new spots may appear as older ones clear or time may pass before the next flare-up. If flare-ups continue, you tend to see large, raised patches instead of coin-shaped spots.Why some people continue to develop nummular eczema isnâ€™t entirely clear. ",,

In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:
Heartburn
Difficulty swallowing
Bloating
Diarrhea
Constipation
Fecal incontinence
When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men. Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma:
Genetics. People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. This may explain why a small number of scleroderma cases appear to run in families and why some types of scleroderma are more common for certain ethnic groups.
Environmental triggers. Research suggests that, in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medications or drugs. Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. An environmental trigger is not identified for most people.
Immune system problems. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. People who have scleroderma may also have symptoms of another autoimmune disease â€” such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome.
Scleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the:
Fingertips. In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die.
Lungs. Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs.
Kidneys. A serious kidney complication (scleroderma renal crisis) involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function.
Heart. Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure. Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart.
Teeth. Severe tightening of facial skin can cause your mouth to become smaller and narrower, which may make it hard to brush your teeth or to even have them professionally cleaned. People who have scleroderma often don't produce normal amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more.
Digestive system. Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine.
Joints. The skin over joints can become so tight that it restricts joint flexibility and movement, particularly in the hands.

0,Psoriasis or Lichen Planus,Psoriasis,https://skinsight.com/skin-conditions/plaque-psoriasis/,https://skinsight.com/skin-conditions/plaque-psoriasis/,"The typical lesions of plaque psoriasis are raised patches of irritated skin that are often covered with a thick, white scale. In lighter skin colors, the patches are most often pink or red. In darker skin colors, the redness may be harder to see or may appear purple, grayish, or dark brown.

Psoriasis plaques are most frequently seen on the elbows, knees, trunk, buttocks, belly button, palms / soles, and scalp. The skin lesions are usually found on both sides of the body (symmetrically). Skin areas of physical trauma or friction may develop psoriasis plaques, which is why the hands / feet, scalp, knees, and elbows are commonly affected. Body folds such as the genitals or underarms may also be affected but tend to lack the classic thick, white scale often seen in other body locations. Most individuals experience itching or skin / joint pain, but some may not.

Plaque psoriasis is commonly categorized by disease severity in the following way:

Mild psoriasis – Few, scattered, limited areas of involvement that account for less than 10% of the body. To generally estimate body percentage involvement, the surface of a person’s palm print represents approximately 1% of their body surface area (ie, 3 palm prints of psoriasis lesions on the body is equal to approximately 3% of their body surface area). Topical or ultraviolet-based therapies are commonly used to treat mild psoriasis.
Moderate-to-severe psoriasis – More widespread disease affecting larger areas of the body and account for at least 10% of the body. Individuals with these more severe forms of psoriasis often require more aggressive medical treatments in addition to or in lieu of topical therapies.
Special considerations – Categorizing psoriasis solely on the percentage of affected skin has important limitations. Individuals with psoriasis who have pain in the joints and/or involvement of certain skin sites (hands / feet, scalp, genitals, or face), even if the overall percentage is less than 10%, may require more aggressive treatment beyond topical medications due to the impact psoriasis can have when involving these special sites of the body.
Other symptoms of psoriasis can include inflammation of tendons or ligaments, swollen fingers or toes, hair loss (alopecia), eye irritation (uveitis), or changes in the nails. Nails of the hands or feet may develop tiny pits or indentations, yellow-brown spots, or lifting up of the nail from the nail bed (onycholysis).",,

A rash on the main part of the body or in the genital area
An enlarged lymph node in the neck
Extremely red eyes without a thick discharge
Red, dry, cracked lips and an extremely red, swollen tongue
Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, with later peeling of skin on fingers and toes
The symptoms might not occur at the same time, so it's important to let your child's health care provider know about a sign or symptom that has gone away.Other signs and symptoms that might develop include:
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Irritability
Joint pain
Vomiting
Children with a high fever for five or more days who have fewer than four of the above signs and symptoms might have what's known as incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of coronary artery injury and still require treatment within 10 days of the onset of symptoms.Kawasaki disease can have symptoms similar to that of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which has occurred worldwide in children with COVID-19. Children with these symptoms will likely be checked for COVID-19, as well.If your child has a fever that lasts more than three days, contact your child's health care provider. Treating Kawasaki disease within 10 days of when it began may greatly reduce the chances of lasting damage to the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle.No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease, but scientists don't believe the disease is contagious from person to person. Some think that Kawasaki disease happens after a bacterial or viral infection, or that it's linked to other environmental factors. Certain genes might make children more likely to get Kawasaki disease.Three things are known to increase a child's risk of developing Kawasaki disease.
Age. Children under 5 years old are at highest risk of Kawasaki disease.
Sex. Boys are slightly more likely than girls to develop Kawasaki disease.
Ethnicity. Children of Asian or Pacific Island descent, such as Japanese or Korean, have higher rates of Kawasaki disease.
Kawasaki disease tends to occur seasonally. In North America, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring.Kawasaki disease is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. However, with treatment, few children have lasting damage.Heart complications include:
Inflammation of blood vessels, usually the coronary arteries, that supply blood to the heart
Inflammation of the heart muscle
Heart valve problems
Any of these complications can damage the heart. Inflammation of the coronary arteries can lead to weakening and bulging of the artery wall (aneurysm).

But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:
Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).
Sunburn and no ability to tan.
For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:
Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.
An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.
Legal blindness â€” vision less than 20/200 â€” or complete blindness.
At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision.If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider.Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes.Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.Types of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected.
Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene â€” one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. OCA is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from OCA1 to OCA8. OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.
Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than OCA.
Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes can occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.
Albinism can include skin and eye complications. It also can include social and emotional challenges.Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive.People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced.Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition.People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress.Using the term ""person with albinism"" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. The counselor can explain the available genetic tests.

The following explains how AKN begins and can progress without treatment. Youâ€™ll also see a few pictures of AKN that show what this condition can look like as it progresses.Before you develop bumps, the back of your neck or scalp may itch. The itch may develop hours or days after wearing a helmet or getting a close-shave haircut.A rash of small bumps appears on your neck, back of your head, or both. These often-itchy bumps can be mistaken for pimples or razor bumps. Scratching or combing where you have bumps can cause an infection, so you may also see pus-filled bumps.Without proper treatment, AKN can worsen. If this happens, existing bumps grow and new bumps appear. Growing bumps can be painful. Some bumps may bleed.In time, the bumps become small scars that can grow together and create a large, raised scar. This raised scar can be painful, and often becomes more painful as it grows.Where scars develop, youâ€™ll see hair loss. Most people develop a large, raised scar that spans their entire hairline. Scars can also appear in patches. Near the edge of the scars, ingrown hairs or tufted hairs can develop. Tufted hairs occur when several hairs grow out of one hair follicle (the opening in the skin from which a hair grows).Without medical care, AKN can continue to worsen. Some people develop swollen areas under their skin that contain pus. Called abscesses, these areas can grow together and form tunnels under the skin. The tunnels are called sinus tracts. Both abscesses and sinus tracts can leak a foul-smelling liquid onto the skin.Why some people develop AKN is still a bit unclear. Dermatologists have found that some people are more likely to develop it than others.

Repeatedly pulling your hair out, typically from your scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes, but sometimes from other body areas, and sites may vary over time
An increasing sense of tension before pulling, or when you try to resist pulling
A sense of pleasure or relief after the hair is pulled
Noticeable hair loss, such as shortened hair or thinned or bald areas on the scalp or other areas of your body, including sparse or missing eyelashes or eyebrows
Preference for specific types of hair, rituals that accompany hair pulling or patterns of hair pulling
Biting, chewing or eating pulled-out hair
Playing with pulled-out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face
Repeatedly trying to stop pulling out your hair or trying to do it less often without success
Significant distress or problems at work, school or in social situations related to pulling out your hair
Many people who have trichotillomania also pick their skin, bite their nails or chew their lips. Sometimes pulling hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign. Most people with trichotillomania pull hair in private and generally try to hide the disorder from others.For people with trichotillomania, hair pulling can be:
Focused. Some people pull their hair intentionally to relieve tension or distress â€” for example, pulling hair out to get relief from the overwhelming urge to pull hair. Some people may develop elaborate rituals for pulling hair, such as finding just the right hair or biting pulled hairs.
Automatic. Some people pull their hair without even realizing they're doing it, such as when they're bored, reading or watching TV.
The same person may do both focused and automatic hair pulling, depending on the situation and mood. Certain positions or rituals may trigger hair pulling, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair.Trichotillomania can be related to emotions:
Negative emotions. For many people with trichotillomania, hair pulling is a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, fatigue or frustration.
Positive feelings. People with trichotillomania often find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides a measure of relief. As a result, they continue to pull their hair to maintain these positive feelings.
Trichotillomania is a long-term (chronic) disorder. Without treatment, symptoms can vary in severity over time. For example, the hormonal changes of menstruation can worsen symptoms in women. For some people, if not treated, symptoms can come and go for weeks, months or years at a time. Rarely, hair pulling ends within a few years of starting.If you can't stop pulling out your hair or you feel embarrassed or ashamed by your appearance as a result of your hair pulling, talk to your doctor. Trichotillomania is not just a bad habit, it's a mental health disorder, and it's unlikely to get better without treatment.The cause of trichotillomania is unclear. But like many complex disorders, trichotillomania probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.These factors tend to increase the risk of trichotillomania:
Family history. Genetics may play a role in the development of trichotillomania, and the disorder may occur in those who have a close relative with the disorder.
Age. Trichotillomania usually develops just before or during the early teens â€” most often between the ages of 10 and 13 years â€” and it's often a lifelong problem. Infants also can be prone to hair pulling, but this is usually mild and goes away on its own without treatment.
Other disorders. People who have trichotillomania may also have other disorders, such as depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Stress. Severely stressful situations or events may trigger trichotillomania in some people.
Although far more women than men are treated for trichotillomania, this may be because women are more likely to seek medical advice. In early childhood, boys and girls appear to be equally affected.Although it may not seem particularly serious, trichotillomania can have a major negative impact on your life. Complications may include:
Emotional distress. Many people with trichotillomania report feeling shame, humiliation and embarrassment. They may experience low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and alcohol or street drug use because of their condition.
Problems with social and work functioning. Embarrassment because of hair loss may lead you to avoid social activities and job opportunities. People with trichotillomania may wear wigs, style their hair to disguise bald patches or wear false eyelashes. Some people may avoid intimacy for fear that their condition will be discovered.
Skin and hair damage. Constant hair pulling can cause scarring and other damage, including infections, to the skin on your scalp or the specific area where hair is pulled and can permanently affect hair growth.
Hairballs. Eating your hair may lead to a large, matted hairball (trichobezoar) in your digestive tract. Over a period of years, the hairball can cause weight loss, vomiting, intestinal obstruction and even death.

Thin, vaginal discharge that may be gray, white or green.
Foul-smelling, ""fishy"" vaginal odor.
Vaginal itching.
Burning during urination.
Many people with bacterial vaginosis have no symptoms.Make an appointment to see a health care professional if:
Your vaginal discharge smells unusual and you have discomfort. Your doctor can help find the cause of your symptoms.
You've had vaginal infections before but your discharge seems different this time.
You have a new sex partner or different sex partners. Sometimes, the symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) are the same as those of bacterial vaginosis.
You thought you had a yeast infection but still have symptoms after self-treatment.
Bacterial vaginosis happens when the vagina's natural bacteria levels are out of balance. The bacteria in the vagina are called the vaginal flora. Balanced vaginal flora help keep the vagina healthy. Usually ""good"" bacteria outnumber ""bad"" bacteria. The good bacteria are called lactobacilli; the bad bacteria are anaerobes. When there are too many anaerobes, they upset the balance of the flora, causing bacterial vaginosis.Risk factors for bacterial vaginosis include:
Having different sex partners or a new sex partner. The link between having sex and bacterial vaginosis isn't clear. But BV happens more often when someone has different or new sex partners. Also, BV is more common when the sex of both partners is female.
Douching. The vagina is self-cleaning. So rinsing your vagina with water or something else isn't needed. It may even cause problems. Douching upsets the vagina's healthy balance of bacteria. It can lead to an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, causing bacterial vaginosis.
Natural lack of lactobacilli bacteria. If your vagina doesn't produce enough lactobacilli, you're more likely to develop bacterial vaginosis.
Bacterial vaginosis doesn't cause complications very often. But sometimes, having BV may lead to:
Sexually transmitted infections. If you have BV, you have a higher risk of getting an STI. STIs include HIV, herpes simplex virus, chlamydia or gonorrhea. If you have HIV, bacterial vaginosis raises the risk of passing the virus to your partner.
Infection risk after gynecological surgery. Having BV may increase the risk of developing an infection after surgery such as hysterectomy or dilation and curettage (D&C).
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Bacterial vaginosis can sometimes cause PID. This infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes raises the risk of infertility.
Pregnancy issues. Past studies have shown a possible link between BV and problems with pregnancy. These include preterm birth and low birth weight. New studies show that these risks may be due to other reasons. These reasons include having a history of early delivery. But the studies agree that you should be tested if you notice symptoms of BV while pregnant. If positive, your doctor can choose the best treatment for you.
To help prevent bacterial vaginosis:
Don't use scented products. Wash your genitals with warm water only. Scented soaps and other scented products may inflame vaginal tissues. Use unscented tampons or pads only.
Don't douche. Douching won't clear up a vaginal infection. It may even make it worse. Your vagina doesn't require cleansing other than normal bathing. Douching disrupts the vaginal flora, raising your risk of infection.
Practice safe sex. To lower your risk of STIs, use latex condoms or dental dams. Clean any sex toys. Limit your number of sex partners or don't have sex.

Youâ€™ll often see small, firm bumps on the skin. These bumps can appear anywhere on the skin; however, children usually get them on their:TorsoArmpitsKnees (especially the backs of)Arms (especially in the crooks)Groin areaMollusca (the bumps) rarely appear on the palms or the soles, but you can get them in the moist tissue that lines the inside of your eyelids.The following pictures show you what molluscum contagiosum tends to look like. This lineup begins by showing you what the bumps look like when they first appear and ends with what you may see right before the skin clears.  The bumps appear on the skin between 2 and 8 weeks after you get the virus that causes this skin infection.When the bumps first appear, you usually see ones that are small, firm, pink, flesh-colored, or white. These bumps will likely get bigger.As the bumps grow, they become dome-shaped and develop an indent in the center, which can look like someone pushed a pin into the middle.When a bump develops on an eyelid, it often looks like a water blister, as shown here.Having molluscum on an eyelid can cause frequent pink eye. When the molluscum contagiosum clears, the pink eye also tends to disappear. Scratching or picking at one or more bumps and then touching skin without the molluscum contagiosum can spread the virus to other areas of your skin.In time, new bumps appear. Some people have widespread bumps, as shown here.Having a weakened immune system, due to an organ transplant, cancer treatment, or an HIV infection, can cause large bumps.Clusters of large bumps, such as shown here on this manâ€™s forehead, can appear.When the bumps become red and look like pimples, it means your body is fighting off the virus.This change is a good sign. It means the bumps will soon clear. This skin infection is usually only painful when scratching or rubbing infects the bumps with bacteria. Sometimes, the bumps feel itchy. The body can clear the bumps on its own, but this can take time. You may see new bumps for several months. As some bumps clear, new ones can appear. This cycle usually lasts about 6 to 18 months before the skin clears completely. Sometimes, clearing takes longer. New bumps can continue to appear for 3 or 4 years, and there have been reports of molluscum contagiosum lasting 5 years.Thereâ€™s no way to know how long it will take for your bumps to clear. Treatment can help clear the bumps more quickly.

Itching skin, weeks or months before blisters form
Large blisters that don't easily rupture when touched, often along creases or folds in the skin
Skin around the blisters that is normal, reddish or darker than normal
Eczema or a hive-like rash
Small blisters or sores in the mouth or other mucous membranes (benign mucous membrane pemphigoid)
See your doctor if you develop:
Unexplained blistering
Blisters on your eyes
Signs of infection
The blisters occur because of a malfunction in your immune system.Your body's immune system normally produces antibodies to fight bacteria, viruses or other potentially harmful foreign substances. For reasons that are not clear, the body may develop an antibody to a particular tissue in your body.In bullous pemphigoid, the immune system produces antibodies to the fibers that connect the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the next layer of skin (dermis). These antibodies trigger inflammation that produces the blisters and itching of bullous pemphigoid.Bullous pemphigoid usually appears randomly with no clear factors contributing to the onset of disease. Some cases may be triggered by:
Medications. Prescription drugs that may cause bullous pemphigoid include etanercept (Enbrel), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), furosemide (Lasix) and penicillin.
Light and radiation. Ultraviolet light therapy to treat certain skin conditions may trigger bullous pemphigoid, as can radiation therapy to treat cancer.
Medical conditions. Disorders that may trigger bullous pemphigoid include psoriasis, lichen planus, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.
Bullous pemphigoid most commonly occurs in older adults, and the risk increases with age.

For most people, hives appear on one or more of these areas:AbdomenBackButtocksChestUpper armsUpper legs If you have hives, they may appear in one area like your back or cover much of your skin.Hives can also develop on soft, moist tissue that lines your eyelids, mouth, and other areas. The medical name for this moist tissue is mucous membrane. This usually happens when something triggers hives like medication, stress, or sunlight.When hives develop in the same place every time, this is called fixed hives. Hives cause raised, visible, and often itchy welts on the skin, mucous membranes (described above), or both.It is a common disease in children.These itchy welts can appear on the skin in many ways, as the following pictures of hives show.Hives appear suddenly, causing a rash of smooth, raised welts that tend to differ in size and shape. The welts can be small, large, or somewhere in between. Some hives are as big as a hand.If you have brown or black skin, hives are often the same color as your skin, or slightly darker or lighter than your natural skin color. People who have a light or medium complexion see red or pink hives.As some hives disappear, new hives may form. Most people have a case of hives for a few days to a few weeks. If new hives continue to appear for more than 6 weeks, you have a condition called chronic hives.Hives can itch, sometimes intensely. Some people say that hives burn or sting rather than itch. Because the skin is inflamed, hives often feel warm to the touch.Some people get hives in a few places. Itâ€™s also possible for hives to cover a large portion of the body, which can feel uncomfortable because hives tend to itch.This means that if you have a light or medium skin color, pressing on a hive will cause the red or pink color to disappear while youâ€™re pressing on it.Sometimes, hives run together, as shown here. The large, raised patches are called plaques.Hives cause inflammation in the skin, so the skin may feel hot and swollen. Some people who get hives also develop another type of swelling that occurs deep in the skin or moist tissue that lines the lips, mouth, inside of the eyelids, and elsewhere.This swelling is called angioedema. It tends to cause pain rather than itch.Angioedema causes pain rather than itch and is more noticeable than the swelling caused by hives. Angioedema usually lasts for 2 to 3 days. If angioedema develops in your mouth or throat, get immediate medical care because the swelling can make breathing difficult.While hives are common, some people are more likely than others to develop them.

Raised, inflamed lines where you scratched.
Welts from friction.
Swelling.
Itching.
The symptoms may occur within a few minutes of the skin being rubbed or scratched. They tend to go away within 30 minutes. Rarely, the skin symptoms develop more slowly and lasts several hours to days. The condition itself can last for months or years.See your health care provider if your symptoms bother you.The exact cause of dermatographia isn't clear. It may be an allergic reaction, though no specific allergen has been found.Simple things may cause symptoms of dermatographia. For example, rubbing from your clothes or bedsheets may irritate your skin. In some people, the symptoms are preceded by an infection, emotional stress, vibration, cold exposure or taking a medicine.Dermatographia can occur at any age. It tends to be more common in teens and young adults. If you have other skin conditions, you may be at greater risk. One such condition is atopic dermatitis (eczema).Try these tips to reduce discomfort and prevent the symptoms of dermatographia:
Treat skin gently. Use a mild soap or nonsoap cleanser and pat skin dry. Wear things made of cloth that doesn't itch. Use warm water when you take a bath or shower.
Don't scratch your skin. Try not to scratch. This is a good tip for any skin condition.
Keep your skin moisturized. Use creams, lotions or ointments daily. Creams and ointments are thicker and tend to work better than lotions do. Apply your skin product while your skin is still damp from washing. Use it again during the day as needed.

Skin-colored, reddish on white skin, or purplish on black and brown skin
Itchy, ranging from mild to intense
Round, oval or worm-shaped
As small as a pea or as large as a dinner plate
Most hives appear quickly and go away within 24 hours. This is known as acute hives. Chronic hives can last for months or years.Angioedema is a reaction similar to hives that affects deeper layers of the skin. It can appear with hives or alone. Signs and symptoms include:
Welts that form in minutes to hours
Swelling, especially around the eyes, cheeks or lips
Mild pain and warmth in the affected areas
You can usually treat mild cases of hives or angioedema at home. See your health care provider if your symptoms continue for more than a few days.If you think your hives or angioedema was caused by a known allergy to food or a medication, your symptoms may be an early sign of an anaphylactic reaction. Seek emergency care if you feel your tongue, lips, mouth or throat swelling or if you're having trouble breathing.For most people who experience acute hives and angioedema, the exact cause can't be identified. The conditions are sometimes caused by:
Foods. Many foods can trigger reactions in people with sensitivities. Shellfish, fish, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, eggs and milk are frequent offenders.
Medications. Many medications may cause hives or angioedema, including penicillins, aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) and blood pressure medications.
Airborne allergens. Pollen and other allergens that you breathe in can trigger hives, sometimes accompanied by upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms.
Insect bites and infections. Other causes of acute hives and angioedema are insect bites and infections.
Hives and angioedema are common. You may be at increased risk of hives and angioedema if you:
Have had hives or angioedema before
Have had other allergic reactions
Have a family history of hives, angioedema or hereditary angioedema
Severe angioedema can be life-threatening if swelling of the tongue or in the throat blocks the airway.To lower your likelihood of experiencing hives or angioedema, take the following precautions:
Avoid known triggers. If you know what has triggered your hives, try to avoid that substance.
Bathe and change your clothes. If pollen or animal contact has triggered your hives in the past, take a bath or shower and change your clothes if you're exposed to pollen or animals.

A small, round bump under the skin, usually on the face, neck or trunk
A tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst
A thick, yellow, smelly material that sometimes drains from the cyst
Redness, swelling and tenderness in the area, if inflamed or infected
Most epidermoid cysts don't cause problems or need treatment. See your doctor if you have one or more that:
Grows rapidly
Ruptures or becomes painful or infected
Occurs in a spot that's constantly irritated
Bothers you for cosmetic reasons
Is in an unusual location, such as a finger and toe
The surface of your skin (epidermis) is made up of a thin, protective layer of cells that your body continuously sheds. Most epidermoid cysts form when these cells move deeper into your skin and multiply rather than slough off. Sometimes the cysts form due to irritation or injury of the skin or the most superficial portion of a hair follicle.The epidermal cells form the walls of the cyst and then secrete the protein keratin into the interior. The keratin is the thick, yellow substance that sometimes drains from the cyst. This abnormal growth of cells may be due to a damaged hair follicle or oil gland in your skin.Many people refer to epidermoid cysts as sebaceous cysts, but they're different. True sebaceous cysts are less common. They arise from the glands that secrete oily matter that lubricates hair and skin (sebaceous glands).Nearly anyone can develop one or more epidermoid cysts, but these factors make you more susceptible:
Being past puberty
Having certain rare genetic disorders
Injuring the skin
Potential complications of epidermoid cysts include:
Inflammation. An epidermoid cyst can become tender and swollen, even if it's not infected. An inflamed cyst is difficult to remove. Your doctor is likely to postpone removing it until the inflammation subsides.
Rupture. A ruptured cyst often leads to a boil-like infection that requires prompt treatment.
Infection. Cysts can become infected and painful (abscessed).
Skin cancer. In very rare cases, epidermoid cysts can lead to skin cancer.

The first sign is usually thickening skin. About 20% of keloid scars appear more than a year after the injury.When it began, the keloid on this girlâ€™s earlobe looked like a pimple. It continued to grow. Most keloids continue to grow for weeks or months after they appear. A few grow for years. Growth tends to be slow. Occasionally, a keloid grows quickly.While a keloid is growing, it may feel tender or painful. It may itch or cause a burning sensation. Symptoms tend to end when the keloid stops growing, but not always. This man developed keloids on his face after chickenpox cleared. Decades later, the keloids still itch and feel painful.The color of a keloid, like the one on this patientâ€™s shoulder, can differ from that of your natural skin color. When a keloid first appears, itâ€™s often red, pink, or slightly darker than your natural skin tone. As it grows, it may darken. Some become lighter in the center and darker at the edges.Some people say their keloid darkens noticeably after they spent time in the sun. This darkening can be permanent.Once a keloid stops growing, it tends to remain the same size. Unlike other scars, a keloid rarely fades without treatment.The keloid you see on your skin can look different from the keloid you see on someone elseâ€™s skin. Sometimes, one keloid on your skin will look very different from another. The following pictures of keloids show how different keloids can look. Most keloids are either round, oval, or oblong. On the chest, arms, or legs, this scar is usually raised and has a flat surface. A keloid on the ear, neck, or belly may hang from the skin.A keloid can range from the size of a pimple to larger than a football.When you touch a keloid, youâ€™re most likely to feel one of these textures. A few keloids have a texture thatâ€™s somewhere in between hard and soft.Most people develop one or two keloids. Some people get several. Youâ€™re more likely to develop many keloids after acne or chickenpox clears, but not always. The girl in this picture developed two keloids after chickenpox cleared.While most keloids are harmless, they can interfere with your life. A keloid can: When a keloid covers a large area or develops over a joint, the hardened, tight scar tissue often limits how far you can move. If this happens, it may affect your ability to reach, walk, and do other activities.A keloid rarely opens upon its own. Like the rest of your skin, you may see a keloid bleeding if you injure it. An open keloid can become infected. If the wound on a keloid fails to heal, see a dermatologist.Having a keloid can be hard on your self-esteem. These scars can be noticeable. Most people who seek treatment for a keloid do so because they dislike what it looks like.When people see a dermatologist for treatment, they often ask what caused them to get this scar. Youâ€™ll find out what causes these scars at Keloid scars: Causes. Images

0,Poison Ivy and Contact Dermatitis,Contact Dermatitis,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/contact-dermatitis/symptoms,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/contact-dermatitis/symptoms,"The American Academy of Dermatology gratefully acknowledges the support from Sanofi and Regeneron.



You can develop contact dermatitis on any part of your skin that touches something which either irritates your skin or causes an allergic reaction. Because we touch most things with our hands, contact dermatitis often develops here.If you have an allergy to fragrance, which is common, you may develop contact dermatitis where you apply a personal care product. The face, neck, underarms, scalp, and tops of feet are also common places to develop contact dermatitis. However, contact dermatitis can appear anywhere on your skin.When signs and symptoms appear, you may have:Itchy skin (often intense)Rash (skin discolored, swollen, and hot)Excessively dry skin that may crack Tender skinBurning or stinging Hives (round welts on the skin that itch intensely)Fluid-filled blistersOozing blisters that leave crusts and scalesThese pictures of contact dermatitis show you what this skin disease can look like. Before the rash appears, you may feel an intense itch, burning sensation, or pain. These symptoms often continue after the rash appears.This man developed contact dermatitis after using a spice-scented deodorant. The itchy rash cleared soon after he stopped applying the deodorant.The product that causes contact dermatitis doesnâ€™t have to touch your skin for long. This woman had an allergic reaction to shampoo, which only touched her eyelid when she rinsed it off in the shower. Because the skin on the eyelid is thinner than elsewhere, this is a common place for contact dermatitis to develop.Poison ivy caused the rash of itchy bumps and fluid-filled blisters shown here. Many people develop an allergic reaction on their skin when it touches poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac.This woman was working with fiberglass, which irritated her skin and caused the painful sores.If the sores break open, they can leak fluid. The sores shown here are due to severely irritated skin caused by handling fish.By seeing a dermatologist, this woman discovered her constantly itchy rash and swollen skin were caused by a product that contained oil of bergamot. When the oil on her skin reacted with sunlight, this rash appeared.If you only occasionally touch whatâ€™s causing contact dermatitis, the rash can come and go. Because an allergic reaction can take time to appear, it can take a bit of detective work to figure out whatâ€™s causing the rash. By seeing a dermatologist, this woman discovered that she has a nickel allergy. The necklace shown in this picture contains nickel, which is causing her rash.Jewelry often contains nickel. This metal is also found in cell phones, laptops, and other tech devices.If you continue to touch whatâ€™s causing the contact dermatitis, your skin often thickens, becomes scaly, and develops deep cracks. This usually happens when someone needs to work with chemicals, such as hair dyes, cement, or solvents. The long-standing contact dermatitis shown here appears on the hand of a massage therapist who uses essential oils to treat clients.While contact dermatitis often develops on the hands, it can appear anywhere on your skin, including feet, lips, or groin area. Sometimes, the cause never directly touches your skin. For example, shoes can cause an allergic reaction on feet covered by socks.Other times, the skin next to something that causes an allergic reaction may not rash. You may develop the rash elsewhere. For example, some people develop an allergic reaction to chemicals used in nail polish or artificial nails. Instead of developing a rash on their hands or feet, some people get a rash on their eyelids. The skin around the eye is thin. If youâ€™re allergic to something on your fingers, such as an ingredient in a nail polish, briefly touching the skin around the eye could cause a rash.This man developed a serious allergic reaction to a resin in his shoes.The rash around this womanâ€™s eye was caused by an allergic reaction to her artificial nails.While rare, the rash on a personâ€™s skin can also be caused by something inside their body. For example, some people develop an allergic reaction to a metal in an artificial hip or knee. A few patients have developed an allergic reaction to their pacemaker.Find out if you have an increased risk of developing contact dermatitis by going to, Contact dermatitis: Causes.Images

0,Acne and Rosacea,Acne,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/really-acne/symptoms,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/really-acne/symptoms,"When you have acne, you can develop any (or a combination) of these breakouts on your skin: WhiteheadsBlackheadsPimplesNodules, cysts, or both (deep and painful)The following describes how each of these breakouts develops, and pictures show what they look like. Picking at whiteheads can lead to more whiteheads and acne scars, so dermatologists recommend that you treat whiteheads with an acne treatment instead of picking at them.A whitehead forms when excess oil and dead skin cells build up and plug the opening of a pore. This causes a blemish that is raised and white or flesh colored. Medical name: Closed comedo, which means â€œclosed pore.â€Dermatologists recommend treating this type of acne with a retinoid, as squeezing a blackhead can cause an infection or permanent scar.This type of acne also develops when excess oil and dead skin cells build up inside a pore. As the buildup accumulates, it widens the opening of the pore and you see a blackhead. Why are blackheads black? Many people mistakenly believe the black speck is dirt. What youâ€™re really seeing is a chemical reaction. When the buildup inside the pore reacts with oxygen in the air, the black color appears. This reaction is similar to what happens when a cut-up apple turns brown. Medical name: Open comedo, which means â€œopen pore.â€If you have a few pimples, you can often successfully treat these with an acne product that contains benzoyl peroxide, retinoid, or azelaic acid. Sometimes excess oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria get trapped inside a pore. The bacteria, which are normally found on our skin, can multiple quickly in the excess oil. As the pore fills with bacteria, inflammation (swelling) develops and a pimple appears.Medical name: If the pimple contains pus, itâ€™s called a pustule. A pimple without pus is called a papule.If you have an extremely painful acne cyst or nodule, a dermatologist can inject it with medication to reduce the pain and help it clear more quickly.When a pore fills with enough excess oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria to cause inflammation (swelling) that goes deep into the skin, an acne nodule or cyst develops. Because these breakouts go deep into the skin, they can feel tender or painful. The main difference between an acne nodule and an acne cyst is that a cyst contains pus. Because nodules donâ€™t contain pus, they feel harder to the touch than do cysts.Some people dismiss acne as a skin condition that youâ€™ll eventually outgrow, but it can have a profound and lasting effect on someoneâ€™s life. Many people develop one or more of the following after getting acne. Acne scars: When an acne breakout clears, it can leave a permanent scar. Some scars cause depressions in the skin. Others are raised. Itâ€™s impossible to predict who will develop scars when the acne clears, but the following increases your risk:Living with acne for an extended amount of time because you donâ€™t treat it or treatment doesnâ€™t workHaving one or more close blood relatives who developed acne scarsDark spots on the skin: As an acne breakout clears, some people see a spot where the acne once was. This completely flat spot can be pink, red, purple, black, or brown, and itâ€™s often mistaken for a permanent acne scar. As the acne clears, it can leave long-lasting dark spots on the skin.Unlike acne scars, these spots will eventually clear on their own. Clearing can take time, though. Some spots can last for a year or longer. The darker the spot, the longer it will take to clear. Treatment and the right skin care can help clear the spots more quickly and prevent new dark spots.Youâ€™ll find out how you can treat and prevent these dark spots in skin of color at: 10 tips for clearing acne in skin of color.The medical name for these spots is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Lower self-esteem: Research shows that acne can deflate oneâ€™s self-esteem, and dermatologists see this in many patients who have acne. Lower self-esteem during the teen and early adulthood years can negatively affect oneâ€™s life. For example, lower self-esteem can prevent someone from pursuing a desired career, speaking up in class, getting a part-time job, making friends, or dating. Low self-esteem is also associated with anxiety and depression. Treating acne rather than letting it run its course can prevent lowered self-esteem.Depression: Studies reveal that teens with acne have a higher risk of developing depression, which may include thoughts of suicide, than do teens who have the occasional pimple. This is why dermatologists recommend treating acne when it begins and continuing treatment to prevent new breakouts.While few people escape acne during their teenage years, some people are more likely to develop deep, painful pimples that leave scars. Youâ€™ll discover who is most likely to develop this type of acne at: Acne: CausesImages

0,Acne and Rosacea,Rosacea,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/rosacea/what-is/symptoms,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/rosacea/what-is/symptoms,"Rosacea causes more than a red face. There are many signs (what you can see) and symptoms (what a person feels) of rosacea.Â Because rosacea has so many signs and symptoms, scientists created 4 subtypes of rosacea. Some people have more than one rosacea subtype at the same time. Each subtype requires different treatment.
    

Rosacea: People with this subtype of rosacea, also called ETR, often have very sensitive skin.


Signs and symptomsFlushing and redness in the center of the faceVisible broken blood vessels (spider veins)Swollen skinSkin may be very sensitiveSkin may sting and burnDry skin, roughness or scalingHave a tendency to flush or blush more easily than other people


Acne rosacea: This subtype of rosacea is most common in middle-aged women.

Signs and symptoms Acne-like breakouts, usually where the skin is very redAcne-like breakouts tend to come and goOily skinSkin may be very sensitiveSkin may burn and stingVisible broken blood vessels (spider veins)Raised patches of skin called plaquesSigns and symptoms


Rhinophyma: Although rare, rosacea can cause the skin to thicken and have a bumpy texture. When this happens, it is called rhinophyma.


This subtype is rare. When it does occur, the person often has signs and symptoms of another subtype of rosacea first. The signs of this subtype are:Bumpy texture to the skinSkin begins to thicken, especially common on the nose. When the skin thickens on the nose, it is called rhinophyma (rye-NO-fie-ma)Skin may thicken on the chin, forehead, cheeks, and earsVisible broken blood vessels appearPores look largeOily skinSigns and symptoms


Ocular rosacea: When rosacea affects the eye, it is called ocular rosacea. If rosacea affects your eye, you may need to see an ophthalmologist (doctor who specializes in treating eye diseases).


Some people get rosacea in their eyes. The eyes may have one or more of the following:Watery or bloodshot appearanceFeel gritty, often feels like sand in the eyesEyes burn or stingEyes are very dryEyes itchEyes sensitive to lightBlurry visionVisible broken blood vessels on an eyelidCyst on the eyelidPerson cannot see as well as beforeRosacea can affect more than the skin and eyes. Because rosacea is a chronic (long-lasting) skin disease, it can reduce a personâ€™s quality of life. Many people report problems at work, in their marriage, and with meeting new people. Surveys and studies report that living with rosacea can cause:Â Feelings of frustration and embarrassment: In surveys conducted by the National Rosacea Society, 41 percent said their rosacea caused them to avoid public contact or cancel social engagements.Worry: People worry that their rosacea will get worse or cause scars. People worry about side effects from medicine used to treat rosacea.Low self-esteem: Surveys conducted by the National Rosacea Society found that almost 70 percent of people living with rosacea said that the condition lowered their self-confidence and self-esteem.Work-related problems: Surveys conducted by the National Rosacea Society find that when rosacea is severe, 70 percent of people say the disease affects their interactions at work. Nearly 30 percent say that rosacea causes them to miss work.Anxiety and depression: Living with a skin condition that flares unexpectedly can cause people to believe you have a drinking problem. This can cause anxiety and depression.Treatment seems to improve a personâ€™s quality of life. Studies show that when people have fewer signs and symptoms of rosacea, their quality of life improves.Images

0,Acne and Rosacea,Hidradenitis suppurativa,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/hidradenitis-suppurativa-symptoms,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/hidradenitis-suppurativa-symptoms,"You usually get hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) on parts of the body where skin touches skin like in the armpits or inner thighs. The following picture shows where HS is likely to develop.HS tends to begin in an area with thick, coarse hair like the armpits and groin. As the disease progresses, some people may see HS under their breasts.HS can also develop in less common locations like near an ear or around the belly button. A few people have developed HS on their face, neck, or back, but this is rare. If you have this skin disease, you may notice breakouts on your skin that look like pimples or boils. Often, these breakouts clear for a while. Later, you may see new breakouts develop in the same area. Sometimes, the breakouts develop in exactly the same spot.The following pictures show how HS develops and how it can worsen without treatment:Before you notice a lump in your skin, you may feel some discomfort. The area where the lump will appear may swell. Some people say their skin burns, itches, or sweats excessively.The first sign of HS is often a painful spot that looks like a deep pimple, acne cyst, or boil. This spot often appears on an armpit (as shown here) or in the groin area. Some people develop a spot on their buttocks or inner thigh.As HS progresses, you see more lumps that may look like acne or boils. These lumps can grow and join together. As the lumps grow together, they fill up with fluid and become painful. These painful lumps are called abscesses.When an abscess breaks open, blood and pus spill out. This foul-smelling mixture can cause wet spots on your clothes. People often feel embarrassed by the odor.In the advanced stages, some people see small black bumps that look like blackheads. These spots often appear in twos.The repetitive healing and reopening eventually cause tunnels to form beneath the skin, which are called sinus tracts, and permanent scars.Some people have HS wounds on their skin all the time. For others, scars may be the only sign of HS for a while.Without treatment, HS can continue to heal and reappear. Sometimes, it worsens. When this happens, HS can progress from a few acne-like breakouts (left) to deeply scarred skin (right).Living with untreated HS can affect your life in different ways. Some people develop one or more of the following:Anxiety: If you donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening to your skin and why you keep getting these lumps, you may feel anxious. Depression: Medical studies have found that people who have HS tend to develop depression more often than people who do not have HS.Infections: A bacterial infection can develop in skin with HS.Itch: HS on the groin, armpits, or thighs tends to be itchiest. Pain: The deep lumps and tunnels that develop beneath the skin can be painful. Some people need prescription-strength painkillers to help manage the pain.Scars that restrict movement: As the body produces more and more scar tissue, the scars can thicken. Some scars become so thick that they limit how far you can move.Skin cancer: Some people with HS have an increased risk of developing a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).This skin cancer tends to develop where youâ€™ve had HS for years. Men whoâ€™ve had HS on their genitals or around their anus for many years are most likely to get SCC.If you have HS, arthritis may be causing your joint pain. In studies, researchers have found that HS increases your risk of developing some types of arthritis.Joint pain and morning stiffness are common symptoms (what you feel) of arthritis. Researchers continue to study this connection between HS and joint pain. We know that both cause inflammation. This fact may shed more light on what causes HS.To find out what researchers have learned so far about what causes of HS, go to, Hidradenitis suppurativa: Causes.Images

Sometimes, the rash causes a burning sensation.Itâ€™s also possible that you wonâ€™t have any itching or burning. Youâ€™ll likely have dry and flaky skin where you have the rash, though.While this rash often develops around the mouth, it can also appear around your eyes or nose. You may have the rash around your mouth and nose or your nose and eyes.Some people get it around their genitals. If you have the rash around any of these areas, your dermatologist may say you have peri-orificial dermatitis.Peri-orifical dermatitis is actually a more accurate name for this rash. â€œPeriâ€ means â€œaroundâ€ and â€œorificalâ€ refers to â€œan opening.â€ No matter where this rash appears though, people often refer to it as perioral dermatitis. That literally means peri (around) oral (the mouth).No matter where this rash appears, the mouth or even the genitals, you cannot catch this rash. Itâ€™s not contagious.Itâ€™s not entirely clear what causes this rash. Something may be irritating your skin, such as a skin care product or toothpaste. Itâ€™s also possible that youâ€™re allergic to something thatâ€™s touching your skin.Many people develop this rash when they apply a corticosteroid medicine to their skin for too long. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so important to follow the directions for taking medications. Be sure to follow the directions on medications that you can buy without a prescription and your doctorâ€™s instructions for using all medications.You may be able to get rid of this rash on your own. To clear perioral dermatitis, you must stop applying all corticosteroids, including hydrocortisone cream, to your skin.This means that if youâ€™re applying a:Hydrocortisone cream without your doctorâ€™s knowledge, stop using itPrescription corticosteroid, ask the doctor who prescribed it if you can stop applying itIf your doctor tells you to keep using a corticosteroid, ask if you can use another medication.When you stop applying a corticosteroid or hydrocortisone cream, the rash can worsen. If this happens, it can be tempting to start using the cream or ointment again. Donâ€™t. Using it again will only bring temporary relief. Each time you stop applying it, the rash can flare.Itâ€™s also possible that if you continue to apply the corticosteroid medication, it will eventually cause the rash to worsen each time you apply it.Before you stop applying a prescription medicine, check with the doctor who prescribed it.While this rash may clear on its own, some people need a dermatologistâ€™s help.To get rid of this rash, you may need to:Stop applying all corticosteroids, including hydrocortisone cream, to your skinTake an antibiotic, such as tetracycline or erythromycinChange your skin care routineSkin care can play an important role in treating this rash. You may need to switch to a mild, fragrance-free cleanser and be very gentle when you wash your face. You may need to use fragrance-free skin care products.A dermatologist can examine your rash and create a treatment plan thatâ€™s right for you. While many patients receive an antibiotic, you may need a different medication.In some cases, a patient may need to use a mild corticosteroid cream for a while along with other medication. A dermatologist can determine what approach will work best for you.Expect gradual improvement. This rash tends to clear slowly. It may take a few weeks or a few months to clear completely.If youâ€™re having trouble getting rid of a rash, you can find a board-certified dermatologist by going to: Find a dermatologist.Images

When a strawberry hemangioma stops growing, it may stay the same or start to shrink.In time, all strawberry hemangiomas shrink. As it shrinks, the color changes to slate gray. The birthmark also begins to soften.When the birthmark shrinks, the skin may break down, causing pain. If this happens, see your childâ€™s dermatologist.  The right wound care can help speed healing and eliminate the pain.Where it usually develops on the body: Most occur on the head or neck, but this birthmark can develop anywhere on the skin or moist tissue inside the mouth or anus.Will it go away? Yes, it usually goes away on its own, leaving little evidence that it was ever there. About 10% disappear by the age 1 and, 90% are gone by the time a child is 10 years old.Medical name: Cavernous infantile hemangiomaWhat it looks like: This birthmark looks like a lump that sits deep in the skin. It may be skin colored or have a bluish-purple color as shown here. You may see thin red lines, which are visible blood vessels. When you touch this birthmark, it often feels warm and firm.


Deep hemangioma on baby's chest

Angel's kiss on baby's face

If you gently press on this birthmark, the color tends to fade. The color becomes more noticeable when your baby cries, becomes overheated, or feels irritated.Some babies have a few spots or patches, as shown here. When a salmon patch appears on the face, itâ€™s often referred to as an angelâ€™s kiss. On the back of the neck, people often call this birthmark a storkâ€™s bite.Where it usually develops on the body: Usually the face or the back of the neck, but it can appear elsewhere on the skin.Will it go away? On the face, this birthmark tends to disappear between 1 and 3 years of age. When it appears on the back of the neck (storkâ€™s bite) or elsewhere, it may fade but not disappear.Medical name: CafÃ©-au-lait maculeWhat it looks like: This flat spot is darker than the rest of your childâ€™s skin.

Nevus sebaceous on child's scalp

When it develops on the scalp of a newborn, this birthmark often looks like a slightly raised, hairless (or nearly hairless) patch. Your babyâ€™s hair will grow around it, as shown in the picture above.As your child grows, this birthmark may stay the same or change. Itâ€™s most likely to change during the teen years. It may thicken. You may notice the birthmark changes color, becoming slightly yellow or orange. The surface can feel pebbly or warty.Where it usually develops on the body: This birthmark usually appears on the scalp or face. Occasionally, it develops on the neck or another area of the body.Will it go away? This birthmark can change, but it doesnâ€™t go away.

Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is often called the â€œitch that rashes.â€ This description explains what happens when the condition begins. It tends to start suddenly with very itchy skin. Scratching the itchy skin often causes a rash. A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:Itchy skinDry, scaly areasRed rash (especially on lighter skin tones)Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)Scratch marksRaw skin from scratchingBumps or rashes leaking fluidBlisters that ooze and crust overAfter healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had  atopic dermatitisFlare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:Thickened, scaly, and leatheryCrackedWhen this happens, you may see more lines on your hands, as shown here, or feet.Thickened skin tends to itch most of the time. Treating atopic dermatitis before the skin thickens can help prevent thickened, itchy skin.Where atopic dermatitis develops on the body tends to vary with age. The signs can also differ with race. The following pictures of atopic dermatitis show what you may see.While atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere, babies and young children often develop it on their cheeks, forehead, or scalp. Flare-ups can later also appear on the trunk, legs, or arms. On lighter skin tones, you often see a red rash with bumps (A). Children with darker skin tones may have several bumps with or without redness and darker areas of skin, like on this boyâ€™s forehead (B).Atopic dermatitis is intensely itchy. When babies have itchy skin, they rub against something. The rubbing can cause bumps, which can ooze and then crust over.You may see dry, scaly skin on any area of your babyâ€™s body. If your baby often rubs up against objects to relieve the itch of the dry, scaly skin, your baby may develop raw skin.The discomfort caused by the itch, rash, and dry skin can cause your baby to act fussy or have trouble sleeping. Lack of sleep is common in anyone who has atopic dermatitis, including babies and young children.As children grow and develop, atopic dermatitis often changes. Hereâ€™s what you may see.Between 2 years of age and puberty, the condition often affects these areas of the body. Children with lighter skin tones often develop an itchy rash in the creases of their elbows or backs of their knees. If your child has a darker skin tone, patches tend to form on the fronts of the knees, elbows, and backs of their hands. Other common places for atopic dermatitis to appear are the neck, wrists, and ankles. Children with brown or black skin are more likely than white children to have atopic dermatitis on their trunk.These creases, which are called Dennie-Morgan folds, also develop in people who have asthma or hay fever.Older children and teenagers may have small, itchy bumps on their skin instead of a weepy rash. Scratching can cause the spots to leak fluid and then crust over. On darker skin tones, the bumps tend to be gray to violet-brown in color.Skin that is constantly rubbed or scratched can thicken. This helps protect the skin. Thickened skin is often excessively dry and itches most of the time.Atopic dermatitis usually begins early in life and may go away during childhood or the teen years. Some people continue to have this condition as adults. Itâ€™s also possible for atopic dermatitis to begin when youâ€™re an adult.In adults, atopic dermatitis can take many forms. For some people, the condition looks the same as when they were a child or teenager. Adults may also develop the following:Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis on their hands. In fact, the hands may be the only place adults have the condition.Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis around their eyes. Youâ€™ll often see thickened skin thatâ€™s darker than the surrounding skin.If youâ€™ve had  atopic dermatitis for years, patches of your skin may have permanently thickened and developed a leathery texture, as shown here. This is caused by years of scratching. The affected skin also tends to look darker (or lighter) than the surrounding skin. The thickened skin can itch all the time, even when you donâ€™t have a flare-up.Discolored, extremely dry, and itchy skin: Adults may develop discolored skin thatâ€™s extremely dry and easily irritated. This often develops on the hands or feet, but it can occur anywhere. Some adults have nipple eczema, which can be itchy and painful. The dry, cracked skin and scratching make the skin more susceptible to infection. Infections that people with  atopic dermatitis can develop include: Yellow or golden crusts on the skin, like the ones above this childâ€™s lip, often indicate a staph infection. If you see golden or yellowish crusts, contact your dermatologistâ€™s office.Molluscum contagiosum: Having atopic dermatitis increases the risk of getting this common viral infection, which causes small bumps on the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, dermatologists often recommend treating molluscum, especially if it triggers a flare-up of atopic dermatitis.Eczema herpeticum: This is a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms include dome-shaped blisters and bumps, along with fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In children, babies, and anyone who is immunocompromised, eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care.Many studies find that having atopic dermatitis can cause people to feel anxious, depressed, or both. This is often due to the itch, pain, and problems sleeping. These feelings can also be triggered by flare-ups. Some people say they feel ashamed when others see flare-ups on their skin.When people feel anxious or depressed, they often spend more time alone. This can cause people to feel isolated.While studying atopic dermatitis, researchers have also discovered that some people are more likely than others to develop it.

0,Eczema,Chapped,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/dry-skin-symptoms,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/dry-skin-symptoms,"Everyday dry skin differs from excessively dry skin, which can require a dermatologistâ€™s help. If you have excessively dry skin, you may notice one or more of the following:Excessively dry skin has lost a lot of moisture, so itâ€™s noticeably dehydrated. Signs of dehydrated skin include dryness, more noticeable fine lines, and itch. When the skin loses enough moisture, it starts to flake off. This causes the rough texture.As the skin dries out, it shrinks. This shrinking causes cracks to form. Some cracks can become deep and may bleed.Some people who have excessively dry skin say their skin itches all (or most of) the time. The nearly constant itch can make it difficult to focus on everyday tasks, such as driving or getting your work done. The itch can make it difficult to fall asleep and can wake you from a sound sleep. Dry, cracked or raw skin often feels painful. When something touches the already painful skin, such as water, some people say their skin burns. In a cold, dry climate, this can happen to hairdressers and others who often have wet hands while at work. When skin loses a lot of moisture, it wrinkles and develops a rough texture. With age, it also becomes loose, as shown here. Excessively dry skin has breaks in its outer layer. This allows germs to get inside, which can lead to a skin infection. Signs of an infection are:The outer layer of our skin continually renews itself. As it does so, the body sheds dead skin cells. You usually donâ€™t see this shedding. When the skin sheds more than the usual number of skin cells, such as when the skin becomes excessively dry, iskin can peel off.When skin becomes excessively dry, it can feel raw from the cracking and bleeding. This womanâ€™s hands have nicks and cuts that bleed. What causes people to develop excessively dry skin varies. Some people get it from immersing their hands in water frequently throughout the day.  Hairstylists frequently develop excessively dry skin due to having frequently wet hands and using hair dyes and other beauty products. All of these can strip the much-needed oils from their hands. For others, excessively dry skin can be a sign of something else going on inside the body. Youâ€™ll find information about the many causes at: Dry skin: CausesImages

Pain during bowel movements.
Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours.
Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement.
A visible crack in the skin around the anus.
A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure.
See your health care provider if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement.Common causes of anal fissures include:
Passing large or hard stools.
Constipation and straining during bowel movements.
Long-lasting diarrhea.
Anal intercourse.
Childbirth.
Less common causes of anal fissures include:
Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease.
Anal cancer.
HIV.
Tuberculosis.
Syphilis.
Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include:
Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing.
Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth.
Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract. This may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing.
Anal intercourse.
Age. Anal fissures can occur at any age, but are more common in infants and middle-aged adults.
Complications of an anal fissure may include:
Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within eight weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment.
Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one.
A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed. This muscle is called the internal anal sphincter. If this happens, it makes it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure may trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medicines or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure.
You may be able to prevent an anal fissure by taking measures to prevent constipation or diarrhea. Eat high-fiber foods, drink fluids, and exercise regularly to keep from having to strain during bowel movements.

You can only get this type of eczema on your hands, feet, or both. Most people develop it only on their hands. Whether it appears on your hands, feet, or both, dyshidrotic eczema can cause these signs and symptoms.Before you see anything on your skin, you may have intense itching, burning, or pain on the skin where blisters will appear. Some people say their skin feels prickly.The tiny blisters develop in one or more of these areas â€” palms, the sides of your fingers, or feet. Where you have blisters, your skin may feel intensely itchy or painful.Some people develop groups of blisters that grow together, forming larger blisters.For some people, the skin with blisters tends to be wet with sweat.The blisters clear in about 3 to 4 weeks. As the blisters clear, youâ€™ll see peeling skin where you had blisters, and the skin will feel dry.People who have a darker skin tone may develop lingering dark spots where they had blisters.Scratching the intensely itchy blisters can lead to a skin infection. This may happen when scratching opens up the blisters and germs get inside. Signs of a skin infection include swelling, redness, and yellow crusting where you have blisters.If you have signs of an infection, get medical care. Some people develop a potentially serious infection called cellulitis, which develops deep in the skin.  How often someone gets dyshidrotic eczema varies. Some people have a single flare-up and never develop it again. Itâ€™s more common to have flare-ups that come and go. New blisters can appear once a month, once a year, or somewhere in between.Whether you get new blisters monthly, yearly, or somewhere in between, repeated flare-ups can cause changes to your skin and nails. These changes include:When this happens, the skin can become inflamed, as shown here. Sometimes, the skin between your fingers or toes develops a soft, spongy texture.The skin may feel scaly and have deep, painful cracks.People who have long-standing dyshidrotic eczema can develop the nail changes shown here. The nails can develop pits and ridges, grow thick, and show discoloration.When you have blisters on your feet, wearing shoes can feel painful. Some people who get blisters on their feet say itâ€™s too painful to walk until the blisters clear. Flare-ups that lead to blisters on the hands can cause other problems. During flare-ups, the pain can limit what you can do with your hands. An auto mechanic or florist may be unable to perform certain jobs. Some people are more likely than others to develop dyshidrotic eczema.

When your skin is dry, you may notice that it is:whiteflakytightitchyscalycrackedinflamedAs asteatotic eczema develops, your skin may begin to look as if itâ€™s been marked or scratched. Thin, red lines called fissures can appear on the skin in a geometric-like pattern. These fissures often surround large, dry patches of skin.Without treatment, asteatotic eczema can cause your skin to become swollen and inflamed. Untreated asteatotic eczema can also lead to a condition called nummular dermatitis, which is characterized by coin-shaped skin lesions.",,

Like other types of eczema, nummular eczema is very itchy. It causes itchy, raised, and round to oval spots on the skin that can grow together to form large, slightly raised patches.No. You cannot catch nummular eczema or give it to anyone.This type of eczema tends to:Develop on extremely dry skinAppear after an injury like a cut, bug bite, or scrapeBe more common in people who already have one of these eczemas: atopic dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, or contact dermatitisWhen caught early and treated properly, nummular eczema can heal within 3 to 4 weeks.This type of eczema often causes round, itchy spots on the hands, forearms, or lower legs.Once you have had nummular eczema, it can return. It tends to appear in the same place. Usually, something triggers it. Common triggers include stress, extremely dry skin, certain medications, or a hypersensitivity to something thatâ€™s touching your skin. If you continue to have flare-ups, seeing a dermatologist can help. If you have a hypersensitivity, a dermatologist may be able to pinpoint it. Avoiding your hypersensitivity along with using proper skin care can prevent new flare-ups. Itâ€™s also possible that those round, itchy spots are due to another skin condition. Ringworm and psoriasis can look like nummular eczema. A dermatologistâ€™s trained eye can see the subtle differences on a personâ€™s skin. For any condition you may have, proper treatment can help ease your discomfort and reduce flare-ups. If you have nummular eczema, itâ€™s important to know that this condition can cause more than itchy, round to oval spots on your skin. Youâ€™ll find other symptoms and several pictures of what it can look like at: Nummular eczema: Signs and symptoms.Image

Heymann, MD June 23, 2016  Take a look at â€œImages in Clinical Medicineâ€ in the June 23rd issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (1).  The authors present the case of a 57 year-old man who presented with a 12 hour history of hematuria. Intravenous urography was performed after the administration of iodinated contrast material. Several hours later, generalized pustular vesicobullae appeared, most prominent on the patientâ€™s face and ears. He had a neutrophilia and eosinophilia. The skin biopsy demonstrated pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, full thickness epidermal necrosis and a diffuse neutrophilic dermal infiltrate. Microbiologic studies were negative. A diagnosis of iododerma was rendered. The patient was treated with thalidomide and skin lesions resolved within 4 weeks. The cause of hematuria was not identified, resolving in 3 days without treatment.  Perhaps there is another answer. I favor the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome, which may affect many organ systems. This patient had hematuria that could have been a manifestation of his disease. According to Daloul et al:  Renal involvement is uncommon and has been reported in the context of both idiopathic and malignancy-associated Sweetâ€™s syndrome. It most commonly presents as proteinuria, and less often as haematuria and renal insufficiency. Biopsy-diagnosed mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis has also been described. Renal involvement usually parallels the clinical course of skin lesions. Steroid therapy results in complete resolution of proteinuria and restoration of normal kidney function in most patients. Some patients may continue to have worsening kidney function requiring a long-term dialysis.  Iododermas have been reported in association with iodinated radiocontrast material (iRCM). Sweet syndrome has also been reported in a patient who received iRCM for intravenous pyelography (3). Old-time dermatologists in the pre-DIF era (well before my time!) will recall that iodides would exacerbate dermatitis herpetiformis â€“ this was considered a diagnostic test. Interestingly, potassium iodide has been used to treat Sweet syndrome, but in cases considered â€œneutrophil poorâ€ (4).  My hypothesis is that this patient was developing Sweet syndrome from the outset, and the iRCM exacerbated the condition. Therapeutically, I would have used prednisone instead of thalidomide.  1.

This rash can develop on any area of the body except the palms and soles.In adults, this rash often appears on one or more oily areas of the body like the:ScalpForeheadEyebrows (between and underneath)EyelidsEars (behind and inside)Nose (sides)Mouth (around) and beard areaBack of the head and neckChestIf you have extensive seborrheic dermatitis, the scaly rash can also develop on your armpits, belly button, groin, buttocks, or under the breasts. Occasionally, seborrheic dermatitis is so extensive that it covers much of the body.When babies get seborrheic dermatitis, itâ€™s called cradle cap and is usually found on one or more of these areas:Scalp (most common)Skin foldsDiaper area (less common)What you see on your skin tends to vary with your age, skin tone, and whether you have another medical condition like Parkinsonâ€™s disease or HIV/AIDS.Common signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis and cradle cap (seborrheic dermatitis in babies) include the following:This can develop on any part of your body that has seborrheic dermatitis, including the scalp, face, or chest. The flakes are more noticeable where you have a rash or hair, as shown here.This rash can be dry, have greasy scales, or both. If you have a darker skin tone, the rash tends to look pink (A), slightly purple, or lighter than your natural skin tone. Some people with darker skin tones develop white spots on their scalp. In lighter skin tones, the rash is usually red and raised (B).On darker skin tones, youâ€™ll likely see a rash thatâ€™s darker than your natural skin tone (A) or light spots (B). In lighter skin tones, the rash is often red. The skin tends to be oily in some areas and dry in others. Some people develop thin, scaly plaques (raised patches) on their face.The itch is usually mild, but it can be intense, especially on the scalp. With effective treatment for seborrheic dermatitis, the itch and burning go away.Your eyelids contain oil glands. When these oil glands become inflamed, itâ€™s called blepharitis. The skin on the eyelids can become scaly, swollen, discolored, irritated, and itchy. Some people develop yellowish scale between their eyelashes. While blepharitis can feel uncomfortable, it rarely damages the eyes.Seborrheic dermatitis can cause inflammation around or inside the ear. You may see flakes, crusting, cracks in the skin, or oozing from the ear.If skin stays wet for a long time, it starts to break down. The medical name for this is maceration, which is more common in areas like the armpits, belly button, or beneath the breasts. Maceration causes pain, tenderness, and sometimes itchiness or a burning sensation. Left untreated, the skin may start to split or become infected.While the rash can be irritating, most people who develop seborrheic dermatitis feel well unless they have another condition like HIV/AIDS or Parkinsonâ€™s disease.Like adults, what you see on a childâ€™s body differs with skin tone and severity.If your baby has a light skin tone, cradle cap often begins with scaly, greasy patches on the top of the head, which later become a thick, crusty mass that covers the entire scalp and sometimes the parts of the face.Babies with darker skin tones have discoloration, flakes, and areas of lighter or white skin on their scalp.Occasionally, cradle cap develops on a babyâ€™s entire body or the diaper area where it is often mistaken for diaper rash. In babies who have a lighter skin tone, the scales can be dry or greasy and the rash red. Babies who have darker skin tones may have white spots, flaky skin, and a rash that is either darker than their natural skin tone or purplish.Many parents of a child with cradle cap and patients with seborrheic dermatitis want to know why they have this condition.

0,Eczema,Prurigo Nodularis,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/prurigo-nodularis-symptoms,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/prurigo-nodularis-symptoms,"Prurigo nodularis causes itchy bumps on the skin, which appear when someone repeatedly scratches, picks at, or rubs their skin. These itchy bumps, which dermatologists call ""nodules,"" can develop anywhere on skin that you can scratch, pick, or rub. While the itchy bumps can develop anywhere, most appear on one or more of these areas:ArmsLegsUpper backLower backButtocksAbdomenThe following describes what you may experience if you have prurigo nodularis.Before the itchy bumps of prurigo nodularis appear, the skin often itches. This itch can be long-lasting or come in short bursts. Either way, it's often intense. Some people have a few itchy areas. For others, the itch covers much of their skin.Instead of feeling itchy, some people say that their skin burns or stings. While rare, patients have said they experience other sensations, like the feeling that bugs are crawling on their skin.The repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing leads to itchy bumps. The itchy bumps usually appear about six weeks after your skin starts to itch, burn, or sting. Often, the bumps develop evenly on both sides of the body.The bumps can be the color of your skin, pink, red, or brownish black. The size may vary from that of a pinhead to larger than a U.S. quarter. Itâ€™s possible to have a few bumps or more than 100 on your skin. For most people, this number falls somewhere in between.Raised, itchy patches can also develop on the skin. Frequently scratching can cause more bumps and raised patches of itchy skin. The more you scratch, the itchier your skin may feel. Some people scratch until the itchy bumps or patches break open and bleed or the skin feels too painful to touch. All this scratching can cause changes. Dark spots may appear. The skin can feel pebbly or hard and thick.Without treatment, the itch and bumps can last for months or years (A). As the bumps clear, you may see flat dark spots (B), spots that are lighter than your natural skin color, or scars where the bumps once were.Living with severe and frequent itch can affect your quality of life. Patients have told their dermatologist that the itch causes them to:Have trouble sleeping Miss days from work (or school)Feel sad, shameful, or helplessLimit social activitiesRetire earlySome people have a greater risk of developing prurigo nodularis.

Sometimes the bumps have tiny white lines running through them. These lines are called Wickhamâ€™s striae.When bumps appear on the skin, the bumps are often shiny, firm, and reddish purple.Most people get a few bumps. Some people get many bumps, which can appear on different parts of the body. The most common places for these bumps to appear are the wrists, lower back, and ankles, but they can appear anywhere on the skin, including the genitals.On the legs, the bumps tend to be darker.New bumps may appear as older bumps clear.When lichen planus develops on the skin, a person can have the following:Thick patches of rough, scaly skin. If bumps continue to appear in the same place, thick patches of rough, scaly skin can form. These patches develop with time and are most common on the shins and around the ankles.Itch. Sometimes the bumps and patches itch. The thick patches are most likely to itch.Blisters. These are rare.Pain, especially on the genitals. The skin can be bright red and raw. Open sores can appear. These can make sex painful or impossible.Some people get many bumps on their skin.When lichen planus appears inside the mouth, it most commonly occurs on the insides of the cheeks. It also can appear on the tongue, lips, and gums. Inside your mouth, you may have:Patches of tiny white dots and lines that can look like laceRedness and swellingPeeling on the gumsPainful sores (can hurt or burn)On the tongue, lichen planus can cause patches of tiny white dots.On the gums, oral lichen planus can cause redness and sores.When lichen planus appears on the nails, it often appears on just a few nails.

0,Psoriasis or Lichen Planus,Sclerosis,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/scleroderma-symptoms,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/scleroderma-symptoms,"Scleroderma has many signs and symptoms. The following images let you see some of the ways it can affect your skin.This trait is what gives scleroderma its name. Some people develop 1 or 2 patches of hard, thick skin. Others have widespread patches on their body. The hard, thick skin can feel anchored in place. If you have morphea (more-fee-uh), the most common type of scleroderma, the patches may not feel too hard. In time, the hardened skin may soften.Where you have hardened skin, youâ€™ll often see that the area is shiny, discolored, and has hair loss. The hardened skin also tends to lose its ability to sweat.Scleroderma causes extremely dry skin, and dry skin itches. The extreme dryness can cause the skin to breakdown and sores can form.The patches of hardened skin can be lighter or darker than your natural skin color. Some people develop violet-colored skin, which means that the scleroderma is active and expanding. This patient has darker and lighter (white) areas that are hard to the touch.This tends to develop on the upper back, chest, or scalp (along the hairline). The skin may feel hard or tight â€” but not always. If you have a salt-and-pepper look on your skin, you should see a doctor. This can be a sign that you have a type of scleroderma that affects internal organs. The sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better your prognosis (what is likely to happen).When the hard, thickening, or tight skin forms over a joint (i.e., the jaw, wrist, or finger), the tightness can make it difficult to move that joint. The patient in this picture cannot fully open her hands because of tight skin. Physical therapy can help you keep the full range of motion. Without it, you may lose the ability to fully straighten or bend a finger, elbow, wrist, or other part of your body.The hardening and tightening sometimes extends to the muscle. This can cause the muscle to weaken and shorten. You may be unable to stretch the muscle. If you have muscle weakness, itâ€™s important to tell your doctor so that the cause can be found and treated.This girl has a type of scleroderma called Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS), which can cause loss of muscle, cartilage, and bone. PRS usually affects one side of the face as shown here. It can also affect an arm, leg, or trunk. PRS is very rare. Other forms of scleroderma can also cause loss of tissue beneath the skin.When a child gets some types of scleroderma, such as linear scleroderma or en coup de sabre, the scleroderma can interfere with bone growth. A leg may not develop as it should. If scleroderma affects the head, the face may become deformed. These deformities are rare.When a person has a type of scleroderma that also affects the internal organs, itâ€™s common to have skin sores. These sores tend to develop on skin that is tightly stretched. Sores are especially common on the fingers. Some people develop pinhead-sized pitted scars on their fingertips and the sides of their fingers.Called calcinosis (KAL-sin-OH-sis), this occurs in the connective tissue beneath the skin. You may feel 1 or more hard, painful lumps beneath your skin. If a calcium deposit breaks through the skin, it can be very painful and youâ€™ll see a white or yellow chalky substance. An infection and painful open sores can develop.This happens when tiny blood vessels near the surface of the skin swell. You may see tiny red spots, usually on the hands and face. It is not painful, but many people dislike the way these look. Treatment is available.This is often an early warning that scleroderma affects the internal organs.The medical name for this symptom is Raynaudâ€™s phenomenon. It causes certain parts of your body, usually the fingers, toes, ears, or tip of your nose to feel cold and go numb in cold temperatures or when you feel stressed. You skin may turn white and then blue. As the blood flow returns to normal, the affected areas often turn red.Not everyone with Raynaudâ€™s has scleroderma. The restricted blood flow, however, can cause problems for anyone with scleroderma. Raynaudâ€™s can damage the skin on the fingers, causing sore or pits.This is often an early warning that scleroderma affects the internal organs. Some types of scleroderma affect the skin and internal organs like the lungs and kidneys. The following symptoms can be a warning sign that scleroderma is affecting an internal organ:Digestive systemProblems swallowingHeartburnDiarrheaConstipationBloated feeling after eatingWeight loss without tryingOther organsHigh blood pressureAbnormal heartbeatShortness of breatheLack of sex driveIf you have any of these, you should see a dermatologist, rheumatologist, or other doctor who treats scleroderma. The sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better your outcome.Images

As these cells pile up on the surface of the skin, you may see thick, scaly patches.Those thick, scaly patches that develop on the skin are called plaques (placks). About 80% to 90% of people living with psoriasis get plaques, so they have plaque (plack) psoriasis1.Â When someone has plaque psoriasis, youâ€™ll often see raised patches coated with a silvery-white scale.Plaques can appear anywhere on the skin, but youâ€™re most likely to find them on the:KneesElbowsLower backScalpPlaques tend to vary in size. They may appear on the skin as a single patch or join together to cover a large area of skin.

No matter the size, plaques tend to be itchy. Without treatment, the itch can become intense. Some people notice that their skin stings, burns, or feels painful and tight.Most people who get psoriasis have it for life. Thatâ€™s true no matter what type of psoriasis you have, with one exception. Some children who have guttate (gut-tate) psoriasis see their psoriasis go away.

Because psoriasis tends to be a life-long disease, it helps to learn about it and see a board-certified dermatologist. A bit of knowledge and help from a board-certified dermatologist can give you some control over the psoriasis. By gaining control, you can see clearer (or clear) skin. Gaining control can also help you to feel better, improve your overall health, and prevent the psoriasis from worsening.Gaining control often involves:Learning (and avoiding) what triggers your psoriasisSticking to a good psoriasis skin care routineLiving a healthy lifestyleUsing medication when necessarySeeing a board-certified dermatologist has another benefit. Psoriasis can increase your risk of developing certain diseases, such as psoriatic arthritis or diabetes. Your dermatologist can watch for early signs of disease. If you do develop another disease, early treatment helps to prevent the disease from worsening.

When you see a board-certified dermatologist about psoriasis, your dermatologist may talk about the type(s) of psoriasis you have. Itâ€™s possible to have more than one type. You can learn about the different types and see pictures of what each type looks like by going to:Â Psoriasis: Signs and symptomsIs psoriasis contagious?Can psoriasis be cured?What's the difference between eczema and psoriasis?1Â Menter A, Gottlieb A, et al. â€œGuidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, Section 1: Overview of psoriasis and guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis with biologics.â€Â J Am Acad Dermatol. 2008; 58:826-50.Images

Eye inflammation. Many people who have reactive arthritis also develop eye inflammation (conjunctivitis).
Urinary problems. Increased frequency and discomfort during urination may occur, as can inflammation of the prostate gland or cervix.
Inflammation of tendons and ligaments where they attach to bone (enthesitis). This happens most often in the heels and the sole of the feet.
Swollen toes or fingers. In some cases, toes or fingers might become so swollen that they look like sausages.
Skin problems. Reactive arthritis can affect skin in a variety of ways, including mouth sores and a rash on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands.

When a child gets hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), most signs and symptoms clear within 7 to 10 days. Hereâ€™s what you may see during that time:For one or two days, you may notice that your child feels unwell and has one or more of the following:A mild feverA sore throatStomach painLess of an appetiteAfter one or two days, the above symptoms tend to clear and you may see:Mouth soresAn itchy rash, usually on the feet, hands, or bothSwollen lymph nodes in the neckMouth sores: Most children have a few painful mouth sores, which usually develop on the tongue. Sores can also appear elsewhere in the mouth, including the roof of the mouth. Mouth sores tend to begin as bright pink spots or tiny bumps, which turn into blisters. The blisters can be painful.Itchy rash: While an itchy rash tends to develop on the hands or feet, it can appear elsewhere on the body, such as the knees or elbows.While a child can develop all of these signs and symptoms of HFMD, most children only have a few.Painful mouth sores may cause your child to stop drinking, which can lead to dehydration. If you notice that your child wonâ€™t drink, contact your childâ€™s doctor.

Most adults who gets HFMD never develop signs or symptoms. When they do, the signs and symptoms are the same as those that children get.While most signs and symptoms of HFMD clear within 7 to 10 days, children younger than 2 years of age may be sick longer. It can take more time for their bodies to get rid of the virus.You can find out how HFMD spreads from person to person and how youâ€™re most likely to get the virus at: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: Who gets & causesImages

A rash on the main part of the body or in the genital area
An enlarged lymph node in the neck
Extremely red eyes without a thick discharge
Red, dry, cracked lips and an extremely red, swollen tongue
Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, with later peeling of skin on fingers and toes
The symptoms might not occur at the same time, so it's important to let your child's health care provider know about a sign or symptom that has gone away.Other signs and symptoms that might develop include:
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Irritability
Joint pain
Vomiting
Children with a high fever for five or more days who have fewer than four of the above signs and symptoms might have what's known as incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of coronary artery injury and still require treatment within 10 days of the onset of symptoms.Kawasaki disease can have symptoms similar to that of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which has occurred worldwide in children with COVID-19. Children with these symptoms will likely be checked for COVID-19, as well.If your child has a fever that lasts more than three days, contact your child's health care provider. Treating Kawasaki disease within 10 days of when it began may greatly reduce the chances of lasting damage to the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle.No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease, but scientists don't believe the disease is contagious from person to person. Some think that Kawasaki disease happens after a bacterial or viral infection, or that it's linked to other environmental factors. Certain genes might make children more likely to get Kawasaki disease.Three things are known to increase a child's risk of developing Kawasaki disease.
Age. Children under 5 years old are at highest risk of Kawasaki disease.
Sex. Boys are slightly more likely than girls to develop Kawasaki disease.
Ethnicity. Children of Asian or Pacific Island descent, such as Japanese or Korean, have higher rates of Kawasaki disease.
Kawasaki disease tends to occur seasonally. In North America, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring.Kawasaki disease is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. However, with treatment, few children have lasting damage.Heart complications include:
Inflammation of blood vessels, usually the coronary arteries, that supply blood to the heart
Inflammation of the heart muscle
Heart valve problems
Any of these complications can damage the heart. Inflammation of the coronary arteries can lead to weakening and bulging of the artery wall (aneurysm). Aneurysms increase the risk of blood clots, which could lead to a heart attack or cause life-threatening internal bleeding.For a small percentage of children who develop coronary artery problems, Kawasaki disease can cause death.

Or they may not appear at all. It's possible to become infected with roseola but not show any sign of it.Roseola symptoms might include:
Fever. Roseola often starts with a high fever â€” often higher than 103 F (39.4 C). It starts suddenly and lasts 3 to 5 days. Some children also may have a sore throat, runny nose or cough along with or before the fever. Your child may also develop swollen lymph nodes in the neck.
 Rash. After the fever goes away, a rash often appears. A roseola rash is many small spots or patches. These spots tend to be flat. The rash often starts on the chest, back and belly and then spreads to the neck and arms. It might reach the legs and face. The rash isn't likely to be itchy or painful. It can last hours or days.

They include:
Reddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back
Patches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center
Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp
A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny
Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone. The condition generally lasts several years and then improves or at times disappears by itself. It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin. It is possible for morphea to recur.See your doctor if you notice reddish patches of hardening or thickening skin. Early diagnosis and treatment may help slow the development of new patches and allow your doctor to identify and treat complications before they worsen.The cause of morphea is unknown. It may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system. In people at increased risk of morphea, it could be triggered by injury to the affected area, medications, chemical toxins, an infection or radiation therapy.The condition isn't contagious.Certain factors may affect your risk of developing morphea, including:
Being white and female. Morphea is most common in white females.
Age. The condition can affect people at any age. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 14 or in the mid-40s.
A family history of morphea. This condition can run in families. People with morphea are more likely to have a family history of morphea and other autoimmune diseases.
Morphea can cause a number of complications, including:
Self-esteem issues. Morphea can have a negative effect on your self-esteem and body image, particularly if discolored patches of skin appear on your arms, legs or face.
Movement problems. Morphea that affects the arms or legs can impair joint mobility.
Widespread areas of hardened, discolored skin. Numerous new patches of hardened, discolored skin may seem to join together, a condition known as generalized morphea.
Loss of hair and sweat glands. Over time, you may lose hair and sweat glands in the affected area.
Eye damage. Children with head and neck morphea may experience unnoticeable but permanent eye damage.

Cold fingers or toes.
Areas of skin that turn white then blue. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see.
Numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming or stress relief.
During an attack of Raynaud's, affected areas of the skin usually first turn pale. Next, they often change color and feel cold and numb. When the skin warms and blood flow improves, the affected areas may change color again, throb, tingle or swell.Raynaud's most commonly affects fingers and toes. But it also can affect other areas of the body, such as nose, lips, ears and even nipples. After warming up, the return of blood flow to the area can take 15 minutes.See your health care provider right away if you have a history of severe Raynaud's and get a sore or infection in one of your affected fingers or toes.Experts don't fully understand the cause of Raynaud's attacks. But blood vessels in the hands and feet appear to react too strongly to cold temperatures or stress.With Raynaud's, arteries to the fingers and toes narrow when exposed to cold or stress. The narrowed arteries limit blood flow. Over time, these small arteries can thicken slightly and limit blood flow even more.Cold temperatures are the most likely cause of an attack. Examples are putting hands in cold water, taking something from a freezer or being in cold air. For some people, emotional stress can trigger an episode.There are two main types of the condition.
Primary Raynaud's. Also called Raynaud's disease, this most common form isn't the result of another medical condition. It can be so mild that many people with primary Raynaud's don't seek treatment. And it can go away on its own.

Secondary Raynaud's. Also called Raynaud's phenomenon, this form develops because of another health condition. Although secondary Raynaud's is less common than the primary form, it tends to be more serious.
Symptoms of secondary Raynaud's usually appear around age 40. That's later than symptoms appear for primary Raynaud's.

Causes of secondary Raynaud's include:
Connective tissue diseases. Most people who have a rare disease that leads to hardening and scarring of the skin, known as scleroderma, have Raynaud's. Other diseases that increase the risk of Raynaud's include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome.
Diseases of the arteries. These include a buildup of fatty deposits in blood vessels that feed the heart and a disorder in which the blood vessels of the hands and feet become inflamed. A type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries of the lungs also may cause secondary Raynaud's.
Carpal tunnel syndrome. This condition involves pressure on a major nerve to the hand. The pressure causes numbness and pain in the hand that can make the hand react more to cold temperatures.
Repeated actions or vibration. Typing, playing piano or doing movements like that for long periods can cause overuse injuries. So can using vibrating tools, such as jackhammers.
Smoking. Smoking narrows blood vessels.
Injuries to the hands or feet. Examples include a wrist fracture, surgery or frostbite.
Certain medicines. These include beta blockers for high blood pressure, some migraine medicines, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medicines, certain cancer medicines and some cold medicines.
Risk factors for primary Raynaud's include:
Sex. The condition affects more women than men. 
Age. Although anyone can develop the condition, primary Raynaud's often begins between the ages of 15 and 30. 
Climate. The illness also is more common in people who live in colder climates. 
Family history. Having a parent, sibling or child with the disease appears to increase the risk of primary Raynaud's. 
Risk factors for secondary Raynaud's include: 
Certain diseases. These include conditions such as scleroderma and lupus.
Certain jobs. These include jobs that cause repeated trauma, such as using tools that vibrate.
Certain substances. This includes smoking, taking medicines that affect the blood vessels and being around certain chemicals, such as vinyl chloride.
If secondary Raynaud's is severe, reduced blood flow to fingers or toes could cause tissue damage. But that's rare.A completely blocked artery can lead to skin sores or dead tissue. This can be difficult to treat. Rarely, very bad untreated instances might require removing the affected part of the body.To help prevent Raynaud's attacks:

Bundle up outdoors. When it's cold, wear a hat, scarf, socks and boots, and two sets of mittens or gloves. Thermal underwear might help. A coat with cuffs that close around mittens or gloves helps protect the hands from cold air.
Wear earmuffs and a face mask if the tip of your nose and your earlobes get too cold.

Warm your car. Run your car heater for a few minutes before driving in cold weather.

Take care indoors. Wear socks. To take food out of the refrigerator or freezer, wear gloves, mittens or oven mitts. Some people find it helpful to wear mittens and socks to bed during winter.
Because air conditioning can cause attacks, set your air conditioner to a warmer temperature. Use drinking glasses that keep hands from feeling cold.

0,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,scleroderma,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/scleroderma-symptoms,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/scleroderma-symptoms,"Scleroderma has many signs and symptoms. The following images let you see some of the ways it can affect your skin.This trait is what gives scleroderma its name. Some people develop 1 or 2 patches of hard, thick skin. Others have widespread patches on their body. The hard, thick skin can feel anchored in place. If you have morphea (more-fee-uh), the most common type of scleroderma, the patches may not feel too hard. In time, the hardened skin may soften.Where you have hardened skin, youâ€™ll often see that the area is shiny, discolored, and has hair loss. The hardened skin also tends to lose its ability to sweat.Scleroderma causes extremely dry skin, and dry skin itches. The extreme dryness can cause the skin to breakdown and sores can form.The patches of hardened skin can be lighter or darker than your natural skin color. Some people develop violet-colored skin, which means that the scleroderma is active and expanding. This patient has darker and lighter (white) areas that are hard to the touch.This tends to develop on the upper back, chest, or scalp (along the hairline). The skin may feel hard or tight â€” but not always. If you have a salt-and-pepper look on your skin, you should see a doctor. This can be a sign that you have a type of scleroderma that affects internal organs. The sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better your prognosis (what is likely to happen).When the hard, thickening, or tight skin forms over a joint (i.e., the jaw, wrist, or finger), the tightness can make it difficult to move that joint. The patient in this picture cannot fully open her hands because of tight skin. Physical therapy can help you keep the full range of motion. Without it, you may lose the ability to fully straighten or bend a finger, elbow, wrist, or other part of your body.The hardening and tightening sometimes extends to the muscle. This can cause the muscle to weaken and shorten. You may be unable to stretch the muscle. If you have muscle weakness, itâ€™s important to tell your doctor so that the cause can be found and treated.This girl has a type of scleroderma called Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS), which can cause loss of muscle, cartilage, and bone. PRS usually affects one side of the face as shown here. It can also affect an arm, leg, or trunk. PRS is very rare. Other forms of scleroderma can also cause loss of tissue beneath the skin.When a child gets some types of scleroderma, such as linear scleroderma or en coup de sabre, the scleroderma can interfere with bone growth. A leg may not develop as it should. If scleroderma affects the head, the face may become deformed. These deformities are rare.When a person has a type of scleroderma that also affects the internal organs, itâ€™s common to have skin sores. These sores tend to develop on skin that is tightly stretched. Sores are especially common on the fingers. Some people develop pinhead-sized pitted scars on their fingertips and the sides of their fingers.Called calcinosis (KAL-sin-OH-sis), this occurs in the connective tissue beneath the skin. You may feel 1 or more hard, painful lumps beneath your skin. If a calcium deposit breaks through the skin, it can be very painful and youâ€™ll see a white or yellow chalky substance. An infection and painful open sores can develop.This happens when tiny blood vessels near the surface of the skin swell. You may see tiny red spots, usually on the hands and face. It is not painful, but many people dislike the way these look. Treatment is available.This is often an early warning that scleroderma affects the internal organs.The medical name for this symptom is Raynaudâ€™s phenomenon. It causes certain parts of your body, usually the fingers, toes, ears, or tip of your nose to feel cold and go numb in cold temperatures or when you feel stressed. You skin may turn white and then blue. As the blood flow returns to normal, the affected areas often turn red.Not everyone with Raynaudâ€™s has scleroderma. The restricted blood flow, however, can cause problems for anyone with scleroderma. Raynaudâ€™s can damage the skin on the fingers, causing sore or pits.This is often an early warning that scleroderma affects the internal organs. Some types of scleroderma affect the skin and internal organs like the lungs and kidneys. The following symptoms can be a warning sign that scleroderma is affecting an internal organ:Digestive systemProblems swallowingHeartburnDiarrheaConstipationBloated feeling after eatingWeight loss without tryingOther organsHigh blood pressureAbnormal heartbeatShortness of breatheLack of sex driveIf you have any of these, you should see a dermatologist, rheumatologist, or other doctor who treats scleroderma. The sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better your outcome.Images

Symptoms may begin within minutes or as long as two days after swimming or wading in contaminated water.Usually the rash affects skin that's not covered by swimsuits, wetsuits or waders. Your sensitivity to swimmer's itch can increase each time you're exposed to the parasites that cause it.Talk to your health care provider if you have a rash after swimming that lasts more than a week. If you notice pus at the rash site, check with your health care provider. You might be referred to a doctor who specializes in skin conditions (dermatologist).Swimmer's itch is caused by an allergic reaction to parasites that burrow into your skin from warm water. These parasites are found in some animals that live near ponds and lakes, including geese, ducks and muskrats.The parasites' eggs get into the water through the animals' waste. When the young parasites hatch, they live and grow in a type of snail that lives in shallow water. The snails then release the parasites into the water, where they can infect humans.Swimmer's itch isn't contagious from person to person.Factors that can increase the risk of swimmer's itch include:
Spending time in water that's infested with certain parasites.
Forgetting to dry off with a towel after getting out of the water.
Being sensitive to the parasites that cause swimmer's itch.
Swimmer's itch usually isn't serious, but your skin can become infected if you scratch the rash.Follow these tips to avoid swimmer's itch:
Choose swimming spots carefully. Avoid being in water near the shore where swimmer's itch is a known problem or where signs have been posted warning of the risk. Also avoid being in marshy areas where snails are often found.
Rinse after swimming. Rinse exposed skin with clean water right after leaving the water. Then dry the skin with a towel.
Skip the bread crumbs. Don't feed birds on piers or near swimming areas.

Head lice affects about 6 to 12 million children, ages 3 to 12, each year in the U.S. To spot the signs of head lice early and help prevent an infestation from spreading, follow these tips from board-certified 
dermatologists. 


Signs and symptoms of head lice include:Itchy scalp.Scratching. Some people scratch so much that the scalp â€” and sometimes the back of the neck â€” become red and irritated.Crawling sensation. People often feel something crawling on the hair or scalp.Seeing bugs. These look like light-brown sesame seeds crawling on the hair, skin, or clothing.Finding lice eggs (nits). The eggs are yellow, brown, or tan and about the size of a pinhead. These seem glued to the hair. If the eggs have hatched, you will see clear shells.Swollen lymph nodes (many people call â€œglandsâ€) in the neck.Pink eye. This is a common eye infection.An itchy scalp is the most common symptom of head lice.An itchy scalp is the most obvious symptom of head lice, but that alone does not mean you have head lice. Other more common things such as dandruff and eczema also can make the scalp itch.You also can have head lice and not itch. It sometimes takes a few weeks after the lice arrive for the scalp to start itching.Image

When vitiligo begins, the patches usually appear on the: FaceArmsHandsFeetIn time, the spots and patches can grow, and vitiligo can appear on other areas of a personâ€™s body. Some people lose color in areas called mucous membranes, which includes the inside of the mouth or nose and the genitals.Vitiligo can also affect the hair, causing white or prematurely gray hair.Some people lose some of their eye color and see light spots on the colored part of an eye. Vitiligo can also develop inside your ear and may affect your hearing.The most noticeable sign of vitiligo is one or more areas of lighter skin. For many people, thatâ€™s the only sign of vitiligo. However, other signs and symptoms can develop. The following explains what you may notice.When a person has vitiligo, cells that make pigment are damaged. Because these cells give the skin its color, spots and patches of lighter skin appear. Vitiligo can appear anywhere on a personâ€™s skin, including the genitals.When vitiligo is actively destroying cells that give a personâ€™s skin its color, the patches tend to be pink or tricolor (causing a zone of tan skin between a personâ€™s natural skin color and the white vitiligo). Once vitiligo is no longer active, the patches turn completely white, as shown here.Vitiligo can  cause loss of color in the mouth, on the lips, around the mouth, around the nose, or inside the nose.Skin thatâ€™s lost pigment is more sensitive to sunlight, so it sunburns quickly. Sunburns can also trigger vitiligo, causing it to spread. Thatâ€™s why sun protection is so important.When vitiligo is actively spreading, patches may feel itchy. Otherwise, the spots and patches rarely cause discomfort.Vitiligo can cause a personâ€™s hair to lose its color. When vitiligo appears on the skin, the hair in that area can turn white, as shown in picture A. Vitiligo can also cause a personâ€™s hair to turn prematurely gray, as shown in picture B.Some people develop loss of color on part (or all) of an eyelash or eyebrow. Others see a streak of white hair on their head.Melanocytes are the cells that give skin, hair, and eyes their color. The inner ear also contains these cells. When a person has vitiligo, the body attacks melanocytes. If the body attacks melanocytes in the inner ear, a person can have hearing loss.If vitiligo affects the eyes, your eye color could change. This happens quickly. While rare, vitiligo can also affect a personâ€™s eyesight.Vitiligo can change your appearance, which leaves some people feeling:Self-consciousAnxiousDepressedAngryEmbarrassedFrustratedIf vitiligo affects the way you feel about yourself, youâ€™re not alone. In talking with their patients, dermatologists have learned that vitiligo often changes how people feel about themselves.Many patients want to hide vitiligo. One woman confided that she wanted to wear a short-sleeved dress to a wedding but didnâ€™t. She was too worried about what others would think when they saw the light patches on her skin.If vitiligo affects the way you feel about yourself and life, tell your dermatologist. With help, many people feel better. Help can range from treatment that may restore lost skin color to learning how to get natural-looking results from camouflage makeup. For some patients, joining a support group or seeing a psychologist helps build their self-confidence.Learning more about this disease can also be helpful. Some people say it helps them feel more in control. To learn why some people get vitiligo, go to Vitiligo: Causes.Is vitiligo a medical condition?Vitiligo discomfort stops with sunscreen useImages

0,Pigmentation Disorders,Albinism,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184,"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:
Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).
Sunburn and no ability to tan.
For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:
Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.
An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.
Legal blindness â€” vision less than 20/200 â€” or complete blindness.
At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision.If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider.Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes.Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.Types of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected.
Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene â€” one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. OCA is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from OCA1 to OCA8. OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.
Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than OCA.
Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes can occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.
Albinism can include skin and eye complications. It also can include social and emotional challenges.Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive.People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced.Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition.People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress.Using the term ""person with albinism"" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. The counselor can explain the available genetic tests.

The color varies with a personâ€™s skin tone and the severity of the melasma. In general, melasma is slightly darker than your natural skin color. Most people see various shades of brown. Melasma can look bluish gray in people with darker skin tones.The following pictures show what melasma can look like. This woman has melasma on her cheek, chin, above her upper lip, and next to her ear.If you have melasma on your cheeks, youâ€™ll see patches or spots on both cheeks, as shown here. This woman also has melasma on her nose, chin, and above her upper lip.The unevenly shaped patches of melasma can join together, creating one or more large areas of melasma.This womanâ€™s melasma is most noticeable along her jawline. When melasma appears along the jawline, it may be a sign that the skin has been badly damaged by the sunâ€™s rays.You may see patches like those shown here on the sides of this womanâ€™s face, chin, and above her eyes.The light brown patch in the center of this personâ€™s forehead is melasma.While less common, melasma can develop on the arms, as shown here. Regardless of where melasma appears on your skin, it tends to become more noticeable when you spend time in the sun. Protecting your skin from the sun can help fade dark patches and spots.While melasma primarily affects women, some men develop melasma. This man has melasma in common places like his cheeks, chin, forehead, and above his upper lip.While this skin condition can be noticeable, you wonâ€™t feel anything on your skin. Melasma wonâ€™t make your skin itch or cause pain.While your skin doesnâ€™t feel different, melasma can take a toll on your emotions. Having melasma makes some people feel self-conscious. Studies show melasma can lower self-esteem because it affects your appearance.If you dislike the way melasma looks, treatment can help. Any treatment plan for melasma will include sun protection. Thatâ€™s because the sunâ€™s rays play a role in causing melasma.To see what else may play a role in causing these patches and spots, go to Melasma: Causes.Images

When melasma appears along the jawline, it may be a sign that the skin has been badly damaged by the sunâ€™s rays.You may see patches like those shown here on the sides of this womanâ€™s face, chin, and above her eyes.The light brown patch in the center of this personâ€™s forehead is melasma.While less common, melasma can develop on the arms, as shown here. Regardless of where melasma appears on your skin, it tends to become more noticeable when you spend time in the sun. Protecting your skin from the sun can help fade dark patches and spots.While melasma primarily affects women, some men develop melasma. This man has melasma in common places like his cheeks, chin, forehead, and above his upper lip.While this skin condition can be noticeable, you wonâ€™t feel anything on your skin. Melasma wonâ€™t make your skin itch or cause pain.While your skin doesnâ€™t feel different, melasma can take a toll on your emotions. Having melasma makes some people feel self-conscious. Studies show melasma can lower self-esteem because it affects your appearance.If you dislike the way melasma looks, treatment can help. Any treatment plan for melasma will include sun protection. Thatâ€™s because the sunâ€™s rays play a role in causing melasma.To see what else may play a role in causing these patches and spots, go to Melasma: Causes.Images

Local swelling, although sharply demarcated, may inhibit use of the hand, the usual site of infection. The lesionâ€™s border may slowly extend outward, causing discomfort and disability that may persist for 3 weeks. Localized erysipeloid is usually self-limited. Regional lymphadenopathy occurs in about one third of cases. Erysipeloid rarely becomes generalized cutaneous disease, which is characterized by purple skin lesions that expand as the lesionâ€™s center clears, plus bullous lesions at the primary or distant sites.  Bacteremia is rare and is more often a primary infection than dissemination from cutaneous lesions. It may result in septic arthritis or infective endocarditis, even in people without known valvular heart disease. Endocarditis tends to involve the aortic valve, and the mortality rate and percentage of patients needing cardiac valve replacement are unusually high.

Folliculitis can appear anywhere on the skin, except for our palms and soles.It usually looks like a sudden acne breakout. Each spot may have a red ring around it, which is a sign of the infection.
    

Folliculitis caused by sitting in a hot tub.

Symptoms can vary. You may not feel anything. Sometimes, the infection causes itchy skin. Itâ€™s also possible for your skin to feel painful.You get folliculitis when you damage your hair follicles. Once damaged, itâ€™s easy for germs to get inside the follicles and cause an infection. A common source of infection is Staph aureus, which is found on our skin. Other organisms on our skin can also cause an infection.
    

Also called pseudo folliculitis or razor bumps, men often see these on the beard area when they shave.

You can damage your hair follicles by:Touching or rubbing your skin frequentlyWearing tight clothingHaving skin rub against skinShavingWhen your skin is damp and hot, itâ€™s easier to damage your hair follicles and get an infection. This can happen when tight clothing rubs against your skin while youâ€™re bicycling on a hot day.The damage can also happen while youâ€™re using a hot tub or whirlpool. When this occurs, the acne-like breakouts tend to appear on skin that was covered by your bathing suit. Most people see breakouts about 12 to 48 hours after using the hot tub.Many people get folliculitis from hot tubs. This is so common that thereâ€™s a condition called â€œhot tub folliculitis.â€While many things can damage your hair follicles, the following are common causes of folliculitis:Hot tub (improperly maintained)Shaving, plucking, or waxingTight clothing or equipmentMedication applied to the skin, such as coal tarMedication you takeWeight gainThe acne-like breakouts tend to go away on their own if you:Have a healthy immune systemStop doing what caused the folliculitisTo clear your skin more quickly and get relief, apply warm compresses to the area.  When using warm compresses, dermatologists recommend that you:Apply a warm compress at least 3 to 4 times a day.Leave the compress on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes each time.If a warm compress helps you feel more comfortable, you can apply it more than 4 times a day.When shaving, plucking, or waxing causes the infection, youâ€™ll want to stop doing these things for 30 days.It can be helpful to see a dermatologist to make sure you have folliculitis. The infected hair follicles can look like another skin condition, such as acne. A board-certified dermatologist can tell you whether you have folliculitis and give you tips to help clear it. Some people need medication, such as an antibiotic, to clear the folliculitis.Seeing a dermatologist can also be helpful if you develop razor bumps from shaving and cannot stop shaving. Some men can continue shaving when they apply a medication to their skin. Your dermatologist can also give you tips that can reduce the irritation that shaving causes.Sometimes. Here are a few common causes and things you can do to prevent getting folliculitis:Wear loose clothing when itâ€™s hot and humid. Tight clothing tends to rub against your skin. When itâ€™s hot and humid, the constant rubbing can injure your hair follicles, causing folliculitis. If you wear tight clothing while working out, you may be able to prevent a flare-up by changing out of your clothes immediately after working out and showering.Use well-maintained hot tubs. Youâ€™re more likely to get folliculitis from a hot tub or whirlpool thatâ€™s improperly maintained. If youâ€™re unsure whether the acid and chlorine levels are properly controlled, you may want to skip the hot tub or whirlpool. This will help you avoid getting hot tub folliculitis.Wash your bathing suit or wetsuit after each use and let it dry. Washing your suit after each use and letting it dry completely before wearing it helps to reduce your exposure to bacteria that can cause folliculitis.Follow these tips when applying medication to your skin. Some people develop folliculitis when they apply medication, such as coal tar, to their skin. You may reduce the risk of developing folliculitis by:

Applying the medication in the same direction in which your hair grows.Shave with care. Shaving is a common cause of folliculitis. You may be able to reduce your risk by following these shaving tips at, How to shave.While the acne-like breakouts of folliculitis tend to go away on their own, it can feel unsettling to suddenly see these appear on your skin. A board-certified dermatologist can tell you whether you have folliculitis and help you feel more comfortable.Images

The following explains how AKN begins and can progress without treatment. Youâ€™ll also see a few pictures of AKN that show what this condition can look like as it progresses.Before you develop bumps, the back of your neck or scalp may itch. The itch may develop hours or days after wearing a helmet or getting a close-shave haircut.A rash of small bumps appears on your neck, back of your head, or both. These often-itchy bumps can be mistaken for pimples or razor bumps. Scratching or combing where you have bumps can cause an infection, so you may also see pus-filled bumps.Without proper treatment, AKN can worsen. If this happens, existing bumps grow and new bumps appear. Growing bumps can be painful. Some bumps may bleed.In time, the bumps become small scars that can grow together and create a large, raised scar. This raised scar can be painful, and often becomes more painful as it grows.Where scars develop, youâ€™ll see hair loss. Most people develop a large, raised scar that spans their entire hairline. Scars can also appear in patches. Near the edge of the scars, ingrown hairs or tufted hairs can develop. Tufted hairs occur when several hairs grow out of one hair follicle (the opening in the skin from which a hair grows).Without medical care, AKN can continue to worsen. Some people develop swollen areas under their skin that contain pus. Called abscesses, these areas can grow together and form tunnels under the skin. The tunnels are called sinus tracts. Both abscesses and sinus tracts can leak a foul-smelling liquid onto the skin.Why some people develop AKN is still a bit unclear. Dermatologists have found that some people are more likely to develop it than others.

You may see a rash, sores, swelling, or other changes. These changes often appear on skin that gets sun like the:FaceLipsScalpEarsNeckHandsArmsThighsWhen lupus affects the skin, signs can also develop on skin that gets little, if any, sun like the: BreastsButtocksBackChestSome people develop lupus sores inside their mouth, nose, or vagina. Hair loss, thinning hair, and nail changes are common in people who have different types of lupus.The most common type of lupus, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), can cause dry, coarse hair to develop along the hairline. These dry, coarse hairs break off easily, causing the sparse-looking hair known as lupus hair.Other types of hair loss also develop. People lose hair on their scalp, legs, eyebrows, eyelashes, or elsewhere. The hair loss may be patchy or widespread. With proper treatment for lupus, this lost hair often grows back.If you have discoid lupus, hair loss can be permanent. Discoid lupus causes raised, scaly patches. As these patches clear, scars can form. When scars develop on the scalp, hair cannot grow where there are scars. Prompt treatment of discoid lupus on the scalp can prevent scarring.When lupus affects the nails, it can cause:Nails to crack or fall offDiscolored nailsSwelling around the nailsIf you have discoid lupus and a darker skin tone, you may develop dark, blue-black nails.The following pictures show some of the many different rashes, sores, and other signs of lupus that can develop on the skin.Youâ€™ll also see ways that lupus can affect the hair and nails.When lupus affects the skin, swelling can be one of the first signs of lupus. When this patient saw a dermatologist, the doctor immediately began testing for lupus. Treatment for lupus cleared her swelling and redness.Occurring only in people who have lupus, this rash spreads out across the nose and cheeks, often in the shape of a butterfly. This itchy rash often appears after someone with SLE or acute cutaneous lupus spends time in the sun.People who have discoid lupus develop these patches. Most patches appear on the face, scalp, or ears, but patches can develop elsewhere on the skin. Without prompt treatment, these patches tend to stay on the skin for a long time â€” sometimes for years.If you have a darker skin tone, the long-standing patches of discoid lupus will eventually clear and can leave behind dark spots (A), light spots, or permanent scars (B). Prompt treatment of the thick, scaly patches can prevent spots and permanent scarring.Discoid lupus can cause sores inside the mouth. People who have lupus can also develop sores inside their nose, eyes, or vagina. These sores can feel uncomfortable.Effective sun-protection helps to prevent this rash, which usually develops on the upper back, upper chest, or arms. It can be mistaken for psoriasis or eczema. The rash heals without causing scars, but it can leave areas of lighter skin.Instead of developing a rash that looks like eczema or psoriasis, some people with this type of cutaneous lupus get a ring-like rash from the sun. A small percentage of people will develop both this ring-like rash and the one that looks like eczema or psoriasis.Lupus can make your skin extremely sensitive to sunlight and other types of light. This patient developed a lupus rash after spending time under fluorescent lighting.Many types of lupus can cause hair loss. With treatment for lupus, the hair often regrows. If you have discoid lupus, hair loss can be permanent because scarring develops. Treating a scaly patch of discoid lupus on the scalp before it scars (A) can prevent permanent hair loss (B).These are most common in people who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Some people develop a nail infection, which can cause splitting or crumbling nails and discoloration (A), or swollen skin and discoloration around the nails (B). Sometimes, visible blood vessels appear around the nails.The different types of lupus can also cause the following changes to your skin:Dry, chapped lipsBlister-like rashLacy pattern on the skin called livedo reticularisDepressions in the skinItchy hivesPalms that turn redHard lumps under the skinPoor blood flow in the fingers and toes when exposed to cold (Raynaudâ€™s phenomenon)Sometimes, a rash or other sign of lupus causes a symptom like itch or pain. If you have symptoms, tell your dermatologist. Treatment can help get rid of these symptoms until your skin clears.Learning more about lupus can also be helpful. Some people say it helps them feel more in control.

The first sign that most people see is noticeable hair loss on the top of the head.One sign that everyone with CCCA eventually develops is noticeable hair loss on the top of the head. Some people also develop symptoms like intense itch or pain on their scalp. Others say they never feel any discomfort. The following explains what may happen before â€” and after â€” you see noticeable hair loss.When you have hair breakage, part of the hair breaks off. This makes some hairs shorter than others, and you may see a lot more hairs on your brush. Hair breakage, especially in the center of the scalp, may be the first sign of CCCA.Before you see noticeable hair loss, CCCA may cause some changes to your scalp. You may feel tiny bumps. Some women say their scalp feels scaly or crusty. Dermatologists think that inflammation in your scalp causes these signs.CCCA gets its name from the way it causes hair loss. The first sign is usually noticeable hair loss in the center of the scalp. This is why you see the word â€œcentralâ€ in the name. Instead of developing one patch in the center of the scalp, a few people with CCCA develop scattered patches of hair loss on their scalp. This is rare.You may not develop these symptoms. However, some people who have CCCA develop one or more of the following symptoms on their scalp:The intensity of these symptoms varies from person to person. For some people, symptoms can become so intense that they interfere with everyday life. Treatment for CCCA can ease the pain and other symptoms. The hair loss tends to spread outward in a circular pattern, as shown here. This is why itâ€™s so important to see a dermatologist at the first sign of hair loss. If you have CCCA, treatment can prevent further hair loss.CCCA is a disease that destroys hair follicles (the openings from which hair grows). Scar tissue then grows over the destroyed hair follicles. The scarring often gives the scalp a shiny and smooth appearance.The hair loss and symptoms like pain and intense itch can take a toll on your emotions. Women have confided in their dermatologists that CCCA makes them feel embarrassed, depressed, frustrated, or discouraged.Research supports the claim that CCCA can affect your outlook on life. When researchers at Northwestern University surveyed Black women living with CCCA, the researchers found that 82% of women said their hair loss made them feel embarrassed, frustrated, or self-conscious.In other studies, women said that having CCCA lowers their self-esteem. Some women said that they start to feel anxious around people.Many women blame themselves for developing CCCA, as it  was previously thought that various hairstyling practices cause CCCA. However, research suggests that how you style your hair may not play a role.To find out what may play a role in causing CCCA, go to Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia: Causes.Images

Repeatedly pulling your hair out, typically from your scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes, but sometimes from other body areas, and sites may vary over time
An increasing sense of tension before pulling, or when you try to resist pulling
A sense of pleasure or relief after the hair is pulled
Noticeable hair loss, such as shortened hair or thinned or bald areas on the scalp or other areas of your body, including sparse or missing eyelashes or eyebrows
Preference for specific types of hair, rituals that accompany hair pulling or patterns of hair pulling
Biting, chewing or eating pulled-out hair
Playing with pulled-out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face
Repeatedly trying to stop pulling out your hair or trying to do it less often without success
Significant distress or problems at work, school or in social situations related to pulling out your hair
Many people who have trichotillomania also pick their skin, bite their nails or chew their lips. Sometimes pulling hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign. Most people with trichotillomania pull hair in private and generally try to hide the disorder from others.For people with trichotillomania, hair pulling can be:
Focused. Some people pull their hair intentionally to relieve tension or distress â€” for example, pulling hair out to get relief from the overwhelming urge to pull hair. Some people may develop elaborate rituals for pulling hair, such as finding just the right hair or biting pulled hairs.
Automatic. Some people pull their hair without even realizing they're doing it, such as when they're bored, reading or watching TV.
The same person may do both focused and automatic hair pulling, depending on the situation and mood. Certain positions or rituals may trigger hair pulling, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair.Trichotillomania can be related to emotions:
Negative emotions. For many people with trichotillomania, hair pulling is a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, fatigue or frustration.
Positive feelings. People with trichotillomania often find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides a measure of relief. As a result, they continue to pull their hair to maintain these positive feelings.
Trichotillomania is a long-term (chronic) disorder. Without treatment, symptoms can vary in severity over time. For example, the hormonal changes of menstruation can worsen symptoms in women. For some people, if not treated, symptoms can come and go for weeks, months or years at a time. Rarely, hair pulling ends within a few years of starting.If you can't stop pulling out your hair or you feel embarrassed or ashamed by your appearance as a result of your hair pulling, talk to your doctor. Trichotillomania is not just a bad habit, it's a mental health disorder, and it's unlikely to get better without treatment.The cause of trichotillomania is unclear. But like many complex disorders, trichotillomania probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.These factors tend to increase the risk of trichotillomania:
Family history. Genetics may play a role in the development of trichotillomania, and the disorder may occur in those who have a close relative with the disorder.
Age. Trichotillomania usually develops just before or during the early teens â€” most often between the ages of 10 and 13 years â€” and it's often a lifelong problem. Infants also can be prone to hair pulling, but this is usually mild and goes away on its own without treatment.
Other disorders. People who have trichotillomania may also have other disorders, such as depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Stress. Severely stressful situations or events may trigger trichotillomania in some people.
Although far more women than men are treated for trichotillomania, this may be because women are more likely to seek medical advice. In early childhood, boys and girls appear to be equally affected.Although it may not seem particularly serious, trichotillomania can have a major negative impact on your life. Complications may include:
Emotional distress. Many people with trichotillomania report feeling shame, humiliation and embarrassment. They may experience low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and alcohol or street drug use because of their condition.
Problems with social and work functioning. Embarrassment because of hair loss may lead you to avoid social activities and job opportunities. People with trichotillomania may wear wigs, style their hair to disguise bald patches or wear false eyelashes. Some people may avoid intimacy for fear that their condition will be discovered.
Skin and hair damage. Constant hair pulling can cause scarring and other damage, including infections, to the skin on your scalp or the specific area where hair is pulled and can permanently affect hair growth.
Hairballs. Eating your hair may lead to a large, matted hairball (trichobezoar) in your digestive tract. Over a period of years, the hairball can cause weight loss, vomiting, intestinal obstruction and even death.

0,Herpes HPV and other STDs,Syphilis,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/syphilis-symptoms,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/syphilis-symptoms,"Syphilis is caused by a bacterial infection. Most people become infected during sex.Without treatment, syphilis can progress through stages and can cause serious health problems. Hereâ€™s what you may notice during each stage.When it begins: The primary stage of syphilis begins 10 to 90 days after you become infected. Most people develop symptoms about 3 weeks after having sex with someone who has syphilis.What you may notice: During this stage, you may have:One or more open sores called chancres, which often feel firm and painlessSwollen lymph nodesThe open sores usually develop on the genitals, inside the mouth, or within the vagina or anus. Because these sores are often painless, many people never notice them.These open sores usually heal and go away within 3 to 6 weeks. While the sores heal on their own, you still need treatment. Without treatment, syphilis can move to the next stage.Are you contagious? Yes. Syphilis is very contagious during this stage. If you have sex (oral, anal, or vaginal), you can easily give your partner(s) syphilis.While less common, you can give someone syphilis through kissing if you have open sores inside your mouth or on your lips.Where the bacteria that cause syphilis work their way into your body, you may develop open sores called chancres.When it begins: The secondary stage of syphilis begins within 6 months of the syphilis sores going away. Some people enter this stage immediately after (or as) their sores clear.What you may notice: As the disease spreads throughout your body, many signs and symptoms can develop. The most common are:Rash (can appear on the skin in many ways and begin before the sores in first stage heal)Sores on moist areas (genitals, inside the mouth, in the throat or anus)FeverFatigueSore throatWeaknessHair loss Weight lossSwollen lymph nodesIf the disease spreads to your nervous system, you can develop other signs and symptoms, including:Neck stiffnessHeadachesHearing lossProblems with your reflexesParalysisThe secondary stage lasts several weeks to several months. Once this stage ends, the signs and symptoms will go away.While most signs and symptoms go away, this doesnâ€™t mean the syphilis goes away. Without treatment, syphilis often moves to the next stage.Are you contagious? Yes. Syphilis is very contagious during this stage. If you have sex (oral, anal, or genital), you can easily give your partner(s) syphilis.While less common, you can give your partner syphilis through kissing if you have syphilis sores inside your mouth or on your lips.A rash can develop anywhere, but it often appears on the palms and soles. It may cause spots, blisters, or many other signs.When it begins: The latent stage of syphilis begins after the rash and other signs and symptoms clear.What you may notice: This stage is also called the â€œhidden stageâ€ because you will not have any signs and symptoms.Even without signs or symptoms, you can still have syphilis.Without treatment, you may stay in the latent stage for the rest of your life. Some people relapse and go through the secondary stage again. If this happens, youâ€™ll develop signs and symptoms again. You can go through the secondary stage two or more times.Each time the secondary stage ends, you return to the latent stage.Are you contagious? Yes. Even when you donâ€™t have signs or symptoms, you can still give someone syphilis by having sex (oral, anal, or genital).In this stage, you donâ€™t have signs or symptoms, but a blood test can still diagnose syphilis.When it begins: Reaching the tertiary stage of syphilis usually takes many years. However, syphilis can progress quickly. Without treatment, some people reach this last stage within 1 year of getting syphilis.What you may notice: This stage is also called the â€œdestructiveâ€ stage because it can damage your organs. In this stage, you may develop:Gummas, which are sores that can grow deep and eat away at the area (skin, lungs, liver, or bone) where they develop.A condition called cardiovascular syphilis, which attacks your heart and blood vessels.A condition called neurosyphilis, which attacks your nerves, spinal cord, and brain.In this stage, syphilis becomes so destructive that it can cause death.Even in this stage, treatment can stop the syphilis from getting worse. However, treatment cannot undo damage caused by syphilis.Are you contagious? NoThe sores on this patientâ€™s scalp are called gummas. This type of sore can grow deep, destroying even the bone beneath.If the bacteria that cause syphilis get into your central nervous system, you can develop a condition called neurosyphilis.Symptoms of neurosyphilis can include: HeadachesNeck stiffnessConfusionRinging in the ears or hearing lossRed, irritated eyes, blurry vision, or blindnessStrokeWeaknessDementiaLoss of balanceIt is important to tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. Neurosyphilis requires special treatment to cure it. You may need tests like an eye exam or other tests to tell if you have neurosyphilis.Syphilis can also affect your eyes at any stage. Signs that this has happened include having red, irritated eyes and problems seeing clearly. Some people go blind.While anyone can get syphilis, some people have a higher risk. You can find out if you have a higher risk and how to prevent infection by going to:Syphilis: Who gets it and causesImages

Thin, vaginal discharge that may be gray, white or green.
Foul-smelling, ""fishy"" vaginal odor.
Vaginal itching.
Burning during urination.
Many people with bacterial vaginosis have no symptoms.Make an appointment to see a health care professional if:
Your vaginal discharge smells unusual and you have discomfort. Your doctor can help find the cause of your symptoms.
You've had vaginal infections before but your discharge seems different this time.
You have a new sex partner or different sex partners. Sometimes, the symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) are the same as those of bacterial vaginosis.
You thought you had a yeast infection but still have symptoms after self-treatment.
Bacterial vaginosis happens when the vagina's natural bacteria levels are out of balance. The bacteria in the vagina are called the vaginal flora. Balanced vaginal flora help keep the vagina healthy. Usually ""good"" bacteria outnumber ""bad"" bacteria. The good bacteria are called lactobacilli; the bad bacteria are anaerobes. When there are too many anaerobes, they upset the balance of the flora, causing bacterial vaginosis.Risk factors for bacterial vaginosis include:
Having different sex partners or a new sex partner. The link between having sex and bacterial vaginosis isn't clear. But BV happens more often when someone has different or new sex partners. Also, BV is more common when the sex of both partners is female.
Douching. The vagina is self-cleaning. So rinsing your vagina with water or something else isn't needed. It may even cause problems. Douching upsets the vagina's healthy balance of bacteria. It can lead to an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, causing bacterial vaginosis.
Natural lack of lactobacilli bacteria. If your vagina doesn't produce enough lactobacilli, you're more likely to develop bacterial vaginosis.
Bacterial vaginosis doesn't cause complications very often. But sometimes, having BV may lead to:
Sexually transmitted infections. If you have BV, you have a higher risk of getting an STI. STIs include HIV, herpes simplex virus, chlamydia or gonorrhea. If you have HIV, bacterial vaginosis raises the risk of passing the virus to your partner.
Infection risk after gynecological surgery. Having BV may increase the risk of developing an infection after surgery such as hysterectomy or dilation and curettage (D&C).
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Bacterial vaginosis can sometimes cause PID. This infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes raises the risk of infertility.
Pregnancy issues. Past studies have shown a possible link between BV and problems with pregnancy. These include preterm birth and low birth weight. New studies show that these risks may be due to other reasons. These reasons include having a history of early delivery. But the studies agree that you should be tested if you notice symptoms of BV while pregnant. If positive, your doctor can choose the best treatment for you.
To help prevent bacterial vaginosis:
Don't use scented products. Wash your genitals with warm water only. Scented soaps and other scented products may inflame vaginal tissues. Use unscented tampons or pads only.
Don't douche. Douching won't clear up a vaginal infection. It may even make it worse. Your vagina doesn't require cleansing other than normal bathing. Douching disrupts the vaginal flora, raising your risk of infection.
Practice safe sex. To lower your risk of STIs, use latex condoms or dental dams. Clean any sex toys. Limit your number of sex partners or don't have sex.

If signs (what you see) or symptoms (what you feel) occur, a person may experience:Tingling, itching, or burning. Before the blisters appear, the skin may tingle, itch, or burn for a day or so.Sores. One or more painful, fluid-filled blisters may appear. Blisters break open and often ooze fluid and form a crust, before healing. The first time sores appear, they will show up between 2 and 20 days after a person has contact with an infected person. The sores can last from 7 to 10 days. Where the sores appear often varies with type:

Oral herpes (HSV-1): Most blisters appear on the lips or around the mouth. Sometimes blisters form on the face or on the tongue. Although these are the most common places to find oral herpes, the sores can appear anywhere on the skin.If a person has HSV-1, a bad sunburn can trigger a herpes simplex outbreak. Flu-like symptoms. Fever, muscle aches, or swollen lymph nodes (glands) in the neck (oral herpes) or groin (genital herpes) are possible.Problems urinating. People (most often women) with genital herpes may have trouble urinating or have a burning feeling while urinating.An eye infection (herpes keratitis). Sometimes the herpes simplex virus can spread to one or both eyes. If this happens, you can have pain, light sensitivity, discharge, and a gritty feeling in the eye. Without prompt treatment, scarring of the eye may result. Scarring can lead to cloudy vision and even loss of vision.If you develop signs and symptoms of herpes simplex, you can expect to have these for as long as listed below:Oral (mouth) herpes: two to three weeksGenital herpes: two to six weeks (the first outbreak)Herpes simplex outbreaks usually develop around the mouth or on the genitals, but the sores can appear almost anywhere on the skin.

Because genital herpes often causes no symptoms or very mild ones, most people who have genital herpes donâ€™t know they have it.If youâ€™re concerned that you or your partner could have genital herpes, hereâ€™s what you may notice:This usually occurs within two days to three weeks after having sex with someone who has genital herpes. The person doesnâ€™t have to have sores to infect you.The sores usually appear on and around the genitals, anus, buttocks, hips, or thighs.The first thing you may notice is flu-like symptoms:HeadacheFeverFatigueSwollen lymph nodes, especially in your groinMuscle painsSome people say they feel tingling or an itch around their genitals or anus. This can last for up to 24 hours.You may also notice a patch of red, swollen skin on or around your genitals or anus. Sometimes, this patch develops on the thigh or buttocks. If this appears, you may see:Small blisters form on the patch.The blisters break open, leaving painful sores.The sores scab and completely heal, usually within 2 to 6 weeks.Most people develop only a few sores, but some people have widespread blisters and sores.During the first outbreak, some people also notice that they have pain or difficulty when urinating.If you touch the sores, immediately wash your hands. This helps to prevent the virus from spreading to other parts of your body. If the virus gets in (or near) an eye, it can cause serious problems.Genital herpes is very common in people who have HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). If you have HIV and get genital herpes, outbreaks can be severe. You may need medicine to get rid of the sores. Youâ€™re also more likely to develop complications, such as meningitis or an inability to empty your bladder.The virus that causes genital herpes never leaves your body. After the first outbreak, the virus moves to nearby nerves where it sleeps. You may never have another outbreak. Itâ€™s also possible that the virus will wake up, causing outbreaks from time to time.Repeat outbreaks tend to be less severe than the first outbreak, and the sores clear more quickly.Anyone can have repeat outbreaks, but youâ€™re more likely to have them if you:Are a manHave a weakened immune systemHad a first outbreak that lasted longer than 34 daysIf you get repeat outbreaks, these are most likely to occur during the first year. Your body will build up an immunity to the virus, provided you have a healthy immune system. As your immunity builds, the outbreaks should become less frequent. They may even eventually stop.Repeat outbreaks are usually brought on by a trigger. Common triggers for genital herpes include stress, fatigue, illness, sex, and surgery. For some women, getting their period is a trigger.During repeat outbreaks, some people notice that they develop warning signs, which tell them where the sores will appear. These warning signs include pain, tingling, itching, or a burning sensation. Warning signs can last for 24 hours.Treatment can shorten how long you have an outbreak and reduce symptoms.Herpes simplexGenital wartsImages

They may have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms.Symptoms start about 2 to 12 days after exposure to the virus. They may include:
Pain or itching around the genitals
Small bumps or blisters around the genitals, anus or mouth
Painful ulcers that form when blisters rupture and ooze or bleed
Scabs that form as the ulcers heal
Painful urination
Discharge from the urethra, the tube that releases urine from the body
Discharge from the vagina
During the first outbreak, you may commonly have flu-like symptoms such as:
Fever
Headache
Body aches
Swollen lymph nodes in the groin
Sores appear where the infection enters the body. You can spread the infection by touching a sore and then rubbing or scratching another area of your body. That includes your fingers or eyes.Sore can develop on or in the:
Buttocks
Thighs
Rectum
Anus
Mouth
Urethra
Vulva
Vagina
Cervix
Penis
Scrotum
After the first outbreak of genital herpes, symptoms often appear again. These are called recurrent outbreaks or recurrent episodes.How often recurrent outbreaks happen varies widely. You'll usually have the most outbreaks the first year after infection. They may appear less often over time. Your symptoms during recurrent outbreaks usually don't last as long and aren't as severe as the first.You may have warning signs a few hours or days before a new outbreak starts. These are called prodromal symptoms. They include:
Genital pain
Tingling or shooting pain in the legs, hips or buttocks
If you suspect you have genital herpes, or any other STI, see your health care provider.Genital herpes is caused by two types of herpes simplex virus. These types include herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). People with HSV infections can pass along the virus even when they have no visible symptoms.HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes. The virus can be present:
On blisters and ulcers or the fluid from ulcers
The moist lining or fluids of the mouth
The moist lining or fluids of the vagina or rectum
The virus moves from one person to another during sexual activity.HSV-1 is a version of the virus that causes cold sores or fever blisters. People may be exposed to HSV-1 as children due to close skin-to-skin contact with someone infected.A person with HSV-1 in tissues of the mouth can pass the virus to the genitals of a sexual partner during oral sex. The newly caught infection is a genital herpes infection.Recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes caused by HSV-1 are often less frequent than outbreaks caused by HSV-2.Neither HSV-1 nor HSV-2 survives well at room temperature. So the virus is not likely to spread through surfaces, such as a faucet handle or a towel. But kissing or sharing a drinking glass or silverware might spread the virus.A higher risk of getting genital herpes is linked to:
Contact with genitals through oral, vaginal or anal sex. Having sexual contact without using a barrier increases your risk of genital herpes. Barriers include condoms and condom-like protectors called dental dams used during oral sex. Women are at higher risk of getting genital herpes. The virus can spread more easily from men to women than from women to men.
Having sex with multiple partners. The number of people you have sex with is a strong risk factor. Contact with genitals through sex or sexual activity puts you at higher risk. Most people with genital herpes do not know they have it.
Having a partner who has the disease but is not taking medicine to treat it. There is no cure for genital herpes, but medicine can help limit outbreaks.
Certain groups within the population. Women, people with a history of sexually transmitted diseases, older people, Black people in in the United States and men who have sex with men diagnosed with genital herpes at a higher than average rate. People in groups at higher risk may choose to talk to a health care provider about their personal risk.
Complications associated with genital herpes may include:
Other sexually transmitted infections. Having genital sores raises your risk of giving or getting other STIs, including HIV/AIDS.
Newborn infection. A baby can be infected with HSV during delivery. Less often, the virus is passed during pregnancy or by close contact after delivery. Newborns with HSV often have infections of internal organs or the nervous system. Even with treatment, these newborns have a high risk of developmental or physical problems and a risk of death.
Internal inflammatory disease. HSV infection can cause swelling and inflammation within the organs associated with sexual activity and urination. These include the ureter, rectum, vagina, cervix and uterus.
Finger infection. An HSV infection can spread to a finger through a break in the skin causing discoloration, swelling and sores. The infections are called herpetic whitlow.
Eye infection. HSV infection of the eye can cause pain, sores, blurred vision and blindness.
Swelling of the brain. Rarely, HSV infection leads to inflammation and swelling of the brain, also called encephalitis.
Infection of internal organs. Rarely, HSV in the bloodstream can cause infections of internal organs.
Prevention of genital herpes is the same as preventing other sexually transmitted infections.
Have one long-term sexual partner who has been tested for STIs and isn't infected.
Use a condom or dental dam during sexual activity. These reduce the risk of disease, but they don't prevent all skin-to-skin contact during sex.
Don't have sex when a partner with genital herpes has symptoms.
If you are pregnant and know you have genital herpes, tell your health care provider. If you think you might have genital herpes, ask your provider if you can be tested for it.Your provider may recommend that you take herpes antiviral medicines late in pregnancy. This is to try to prevent an outbreak around the time of delivery. If you have an outbreak when you go into labor, your provider may suggest a cesarean section. That is a surgery to remove the baby from your uterus. It lowers the risk of passing the virus to your baby.

Youâ€™ll often see small, firm bumps on the skin. These bumps can appear anywhere on the skin; however, children usually get them on their:TorsoArmpitsKnees (especially the backs of)Arms (especially in the crooks)Groin areaMollusca (the bumps) rarely appear on the palms or the soles, but you can get them in the moist tissue that lines the inside of your eyelids.The following pictures show you what molluscum contagiosum tends to look like. This lineup begins by showing you what the bumps look like when they first appear and ends with what you may see right before the skin clears.  The bumps appear on the skin between 2 and 8 weeks after you get the virus that causes this skin infection.When the bumps first appear, you usually see ones that are small, firm, pink, flesh-colored, or white. These bumps will likely get bigger.As the bumps grow, they become dome-shaped and develop an indent in the center, which can look like someone pushed a pin into the middle.When a bump develops on an eyelid, it often looks like a water blister, as shown here.Having molluscum on an eyelid can cause frequent pink eye. When the molluscum contagiosum clears, the pink eye also tends to disappear. Scratching or picking at one or more bumps and then touching skin without the molluscum contagiosum can spread the virus to other areas of your skin.In time, new bumps appear. Some people have widespread bumps, as shown here.Having a weakened immune system, due to an organ transplant, cancer treatment, or an HIV infection, can cause large bumps.Clusters of large bumps, such as shown here on this manâ€™s forehead, can appear.When the bumps become red and look like pimples, it means your body is fighting off the virus.This change is a good sign. It means the bumps will soon clear. This skin infection is usually only painful when scratching or rubbing infects the bumps with bacteria. Sometimes, the bumps feel itchy. The body can clear the bumps on its own, but this can take time. You may see new bumps for several months. As some bumps clear, new ones can appear. This cycle usually lasts about 6 to 18 months before the skin clears completely. Sometimes, clearing takes longer. New bumps can continue to appear for 3 or 4 years, and there have been reports of molluscum contagiosum lasting 5 years.",,

The type is determined by where it grows on the body and what it looks like. The following describes the signs (what a person sees) and symptoms (what a person feels) for some of the different types of warts.(also called vurruca vulgaris)Common warts have these traits:Grow most often on the fingers, around the nails, and on the backs of the hands.Are more common where skin was broken, such as from biting fingernails or picking at hangnails.Can have black dots that look like seeds (often called ""seed"" warts).Most often feel like rough bumps.Children frequently get common warts. If you see a wart on your child's face, check your child's hands for warts. The virus can spread from the hands to the face through touch or nail biting.(also called plantar warts)Plantar warts have these traits:Grow most often on the soles (plantar surface) of the feetCan grow in clusters (mosaic warts)Often are flat or grow inward (walking creates pressure, which causes the warts to grow inward)Can hurt, feels like you have pebbles in your shoeCan have black dotsThese warts appear on the sole of the foot and can be hard to treat.Flat warts have these traits:Can occur anywhere.

Blisters can appear suddenly and spread. Widespread pemphigus can be life threatening. It can turn an otherwise healthy person into one who is extremely sick, incredibly tired, and in pain.The following explains how pemphigus affects different areas of the body.On the skin, blisters usually begin in one area. They can develop on normal-looking skin or skin that looks inflamed. Either way, the blisters soon break open and ooze fluids. They then become sores partly covered with crust.The following pictures show what pemphigus can look like on the skin.The blisters have burst, leaving painful sores. About 70% of people who get
pemphigus have this type.This type of pemphigus affects only the skin and often develops on the face, scalp, and upper body.Some people get pemphigus after taking certain medicines. This man took penicillamine, which is the most common cause of drug-induced pemphigus.The sores are often painful, but rarely itchy. Some people say the affected skin burns.The sores tend to heal slowly, and some never heal. When a sore heals, you may see a dark spot in its place. This is not a scar. Some people see dark spots when their skin heals. The dark spots often fade on their own, but this can take time.Painful mouth sores are common in people who have pemphigus vulgaris, the most common type of pemphigus. About 50% to 70% of people who have pemphigus vulgaris develop mouth sores before blisters appear on their skin.Mouth sores begin as blisters, which quickly burst causing the painful sores.These sores can be so painful that some people stop eating solid food and use a straw to drink. If sores develop in the throat, talking can be painful.Some people see the blisters spread from their mouth to their lips and then their skin.Most people who have pemphigus vulgaris develop mouth sores at some point.Nail problems develop in some people who have severe pemphigus. An infection may develop in the skin around the nail as shown here. Some people see their nails slowly disappear.With treatment, most people can recover lost nails.While rare, pemphigus can affect the nails and surrounding skin.Painful sores can develop in the tissue lining the inside of the eyes and nose, genitals, anus, and other areas of the body. Even the esophagus (the tube that connects the throat to the stomach) can develop blisters and sores in rare cases.PainFatigueWeaknessLight sensitivityEye problemsIf you notice blisters that suddenly appear on your skin, inside your mouth, or elsewhere, immediately make an appointment to see a board-certified dermatologist.

Itching skin, weeks or months before blisters form
Large blisters that don't easily rupture when touched, often along creases or folds in the skin
Skin around the blisters that is normal, reddish or darker than normal
Eczema or a hive-like rash
Small blisters or sores in the mouth or other mucous membranes (benign mucous membrane pemphigoid)
See your doctor if you develop:
Unexplained blistering
Blisters on your eyes
Signs of infection
The blisters occur because of a malfunction in your immune system.Your body's immune system normally produces antibodies to fight bacteria, viruses or other potentially harmful foreign substances. For reasons that are not clear, the body may develop an antibody to a particular tissue in your body.In bullous pemphigoid, the immune system produces antibodies to the fibers that connect the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the next layer of skin (dermis). These antibodies trigger inflammation that produces the blisters and itching of bullous pemphigoid.Bullous pemphigoid usually appears randomly with no clear factors contributing to the onset of disease. Some cases may be triggered by:
Medications. Prescription drugs that may cause bullous pemphigoid include etanercept (Enbrel), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), furosemide (Lasix) and penicillin.
Light and radiation. Ultraviolet light therapy to treat certain skin conditions may trigger bullous pemphigoid, as can radiation therapy to treat cancer.
Medical conditions. Disorders that may trigger bullous pemphigoid include psoriasis, lichen planus, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.
Bullous pemphigoid most commonly occurs in older adults, and the risk increases with age.

To prevent and treat dry, chapped lips at home, follow these tips from board-certified dermatologists.Cold, dry weather, sun damage, and frequently licking your lips are just some of the reasons your lips might feel dry and chapped. To prevent and treat dry, chapped lips at home, follow these tips from board-certified dermatologists.While it may seem that dry, cracked lips are something you must live with until spring comes, you can have soft, supple lips year-round. Hereâ€™s what dermatologists recommend.Use non-irritating lip balm, lipstick, and other products that you apply to your lips. Many people mistake discomfort, such as burning, stinging, or tingling, as a sign that the active ingredients in a product are working. Thatâ€™s not whatâ€™s happening. Youâ€™re actually irritating your lips, so you want to stop using any product that irritates your lips.
Ingredients to avoid while your lips are chapped: To help chapped lips heal, stop applying lip products that contain any of the following:


CamphorIf your lips burn, sting, or feel uncomfortable when you apply a product to your lips, it means youâ€™re irritating your lips, so you want to stop using that product.

Apply a non-irritating lip balm (or lip moisturizer) several times a day and before bed. If your lips are very dry and cracked, try a thick ointment, such as white petroleum jelly. Ointment seals in water longer than waxes or oils.Slather on a non-irritating lip balm with SPF 30 or higher before going outdoors. Even in the winter, itâ€™s important to protect your lips from the sun. The sun can burn dry, chapped lips more easily, which could trigger cold sores.

To protect dry, chapped lips from the sun, use lip balm that contains offers SPF 30 or higher and one (or both) of these sun-protective ingredients:
Titanium oxideDrink plenty of water. Chapped lips are dry lips, so you want to stay hydrated.Stop licking, biting, and picking at your lips. When lips feel dry, it may feel natural to wet them by licking them, but this can worsen the problem. As saliva evaporates, your lips become drier.

Picking or biting your lips also irritates them, which can prevent healing.Lip licking can be a hard habit to break. When you catch yourself licking your lips, try applying a non-irritating lip balm instead.Avoid holding items made of metal with your lips. Paperclips, jewelry, and other everyday products made of metal can irritate your already sensitive lips.Plug in a humidifier at home. A humidifier in your bedroom can be especially helpful, especially if you breathe through your mouth at night.By following these dermatologistsâ€™ tips for chapped lips, you should have noticeable improvement in 2 to 3 weeks. To prevent your lips from chapping again, continue applying lip balm whenever itâ€™s dry indoors or outside.Most of the time, the above self-care can heal dry, chapped lips in 2 to 3 weeks. If it doesnâ€™t, see a board-certified dermatologist.Your chapped lips could be caused by something aside from dry weather. An allergic reaction, yeast infection, or something more serious can make your lips feel dry and uncomfortable. Actinic cheilitis is a precancerous condition that turns one or both lips dry and scaly. A board-certified dermatologist can diagnose the cause.No one understands your skin better than a board-certified dermatologist.

Signs and symptoms may include:
Creamy white lesions on your tongue, inner cheeks, and sometimes on the roof of your mouth, gums and tonsils
Slightly raised lesions with a cottage cheese-like appearance
Redness, burning or soreness that may be severe enough to cause difficulty eating or swallowing
Slight bleeding if the lesions are rubbed or scraped
Cracking and redness at the corners of your mouth
A cottony feeling in your mouth
Loss of taste
Redness, irritation and pain under dentures (denture stomatitis)
In severe cases, usually related to cancer or a weakened immune system from HIV/AIDS, the lesions may spread downward into your esophagus â€” the long, muscular tube stretching from the back of your mouth to your stomach (Candida esophagitis). If this occurs, you may experience difficulty swallowing and pain or feel as if food is getting stuck in your throat.In addition to the distinctive white mouth lesions, infants may have trouble feeding or be fussy and irritable. They can pass the infection to their mothers during breast-feeding. The infection may then pass back and forth between the mother's breasts and the baby's mouth.Women whose breasts are infected with candida may experience these signs and symptoms:
Unusually red, sensitive, cracked or itchy nipples
Shiny or flaky skin on the darker, circular area around the nipple (areola)
Unusual pain during nursing or painful nipples between feedings
Stabbing pains deep within the breast
If you or your child develops white lesions inside the mouth, see your doctor or dentist.Thrush is uncommon in healthy older children, teenagers and adults, so if thrush develops, see your doctor to determine if further evaluation is needed to check for an underlying medical condition or other cause.Normally, your immune system works to repel harmful invading organisms, such as viruses, bacteria and fungi, while maintaining a balance between ""good"" and ""bad"" microbes that normally inhabit your body. But sometimes these protective mechanisms fail, increasing the number of candida fungus and allowing an oral thrush infection to take hold.The most common type of candida fungus is Candida albicans. Several factors, such as a weakened immune system, can increase your risk of oral thrush.You may have an increased risk of oral thrush infection if any of these issues apply:
Weakened immunity. Oral thrush is more likely to occur in infants and older adults due to reduced immunity. Some medical conditions and treatments can suppress your immune system, such as cancer and its treatments, organ transplantation and required drugs that suppress the immune system, and HIV/AIDS.
Diabetes. If you have untreated diabetes or the disease isn't well-controlled, your saliva may contain large amounts of sugar, which encourages the growth of candida.
Vaginal yeast infections. Vaginal yeast infections are caused by the same fungus that causes oral thrush. You can pass the infection to your baby.
Medications. Drugs such as prednisone, inhaled corticosteroids, or antibiotics that disturb the natural balance of microorganisms in your body can increase your risk of oral thrush.
Other oral conditions. Wearing dentures, especially upper dentures, or having conditions that cause dry mouth can increase the risk of oral thrush.
Oral thrush is seldom a problem for healthy children and adults.For people with lowered immunity, such as from cancer treatment or HIV/AIDS, thrush can be more serious. Untreated oral thrush can lead to more-serious systemic candida infections. If you have a weakened immune system, thrush may spread to your esophagus or other parts of your body.These measures may help reduce your risk of developing candida infections:
Rinse your mouth. If you need to use a corticosteroid inhaler, be sure to rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth after taking your medication.
Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily or as often as your dentist recommends.
Check your dentures. Remove your dentures at night. Make sure dentures fit properly and don't cause irritation. Clean your dentures daily. Ask your dentist for the best way to clean your type of dentures.
See your dentist regularly, especially if you have diabetes or wear dentures. Ask your dentist how often you need to be seen.
Watch what you eat. Try limiting the amount of sugar-containing foods you eat. These may encourage the growth of candida.
Maintain good blood sugar control if you have diabetes. Well-controlled blood sugar can reduce the amount of sugar in your saliva, discouraging the growth of candida.
Treat a vaginal yeast infection as soon as possible.
Treat dry mouth. Ask your doctor about ways to avoid or treat your dry mouth.

If you have a rash and notice any of the symptoms in this video, see a board-certified dermatologist for treatment.Ringworm is an infection caused by fungus. You can get ringworm anywhere on your skin.On most areas of the skin, it causes ring-shaped patches. What you see, however, changes when ringworm grows on the feet (bottoms and sides), palms, nails, groin, beard area, or scalp.Roundish, flat patches that have a raised, scaly borderOn light-colored skin, the patches tend to be red or pinkOn skin of color, the patches are usually brown or grayPatches can grow slowly, increasing in size and appearing on more areas of the bodyThe center of a patch tends to clear firstThe patches can be intensely itchyA ringworm infection on the skin is indicated by roundish, flat patches that have a raised, scaly border.

Most men get it when they have contact with infected animal, which may explain why farmers and ranchers seem to develop it more often. Signs and symptoms appear on the bearded area of the face and neck, and you may notice:Intense redness and swellingPus-filled bumpsHair loss (hair often returns when ringworm is treated)Swollen lymph nodesRaw, open skinRaised soft, spongy skin that weeps fluidA skin problem that looks like acne, folliculitis, or another skin conditionSome men feel tired and rundownA ringworm infection can develop in men who can grow facial hair.

Common signs and symptoms are:
Scaly, peeling or cracked skin between the toes
Itchiness, especially right after taking off shoes and socks
Inflamed skin that might appear reddish, purplish or grayish, depending on your skin color
Burning or stinging
Blisters
Dry, scaly skin on the bottom of the foot that extends up the side
If you have a rash on your foot that doesn't improve within two weeks of beginning self-treatment with an over-the-counter antifungal product, see your doctor.If you have diabetes, see your doctor if you suspect that you have athlete's foot. Also see your doctor if you have signs of an infection â€” swelling of the affected area, pus, fever.Athlete's foot is caused by the same type of fungi (dermatophytes) that cause ringworm and jock itch. Damp socks and shoes and warm, humid conditions favor the organisms' growth.Athlete's foot is contagious and can spread through contact with an infected person or from contact with contaminated surfaces, such as towels, floors and shoes. You can also spread it from the foot to other parts of the body, especially if you scratch or pick the infected parts of your foot.You are at higher risk of athlete's foot if you:
Frequently wear enclosed footwear
Sweat heavily
Share mats, rugs, bed linens, clothes or shoes with someone who has a fungal infection
Walk barefoot in public areas where the infection can spread, such as locker rooms, saunas, swimming pools, communal baths and showers
The athlete's foot infection can spread to other warm, moist parts of the body. Jock itch is often caused by the same fungus that results in athlete's foot. It's common for the infection to spread from the feet to the groin because the fungus can travel on hands or towels.Athlete's foot can sometimes lead to bacterial infections.These tips can help you avoid athlete's foot or avoid spreading it to others:
Let your feet air out. When you can, wear sandals to let your feet air out as much as possible.
Wash your feet daily. Use warm, soapy water and rinse and dry your feet thoroughly, especially between the toes. Apply a medicated foot powder (Tinactin, Gold Bond, others) or other medicated powder (Lotrimin AF, Zeasorb, others) if you're prone to athlete's foot.
Change socks regularly. Change your socks at least once a day â€” more often if your feet get really sweaty. Moisture-wicking socks, such as those made from cotton, help keep your feet drier than do nylon socks.
Alternate pairs of shoes. Use different shoes from day to day. This gives your shoes time to dry after each use.
Protect your feet in public places. Wear waterproof sandals or shoes around public pools, showers and lockers rooms.
Be aware of the risk factors for spreading the condition. If you live with others, don't share shoes or unwashed bedding and towels.

A spreading rash that begins in the crease of the groin and moves down the upper thigh and buttocks.
A rash whose center tends to clear as the rash spreads.
A rash that may be full or partially ring shaped.
A rash bordered with small blisters.
Itchiness.
Scaly skin.
A rash that might be red, brown, purple or gray depending on your skin color.
See your doctor if your rash is painful or you develop a fever. And seek medical care if the rash hasn't improved after a week of self-care with the type of antifungal product you can get without a prescription. Also seek medical care if the rash hasn't cleared up fully after three weeks of treatment.Jock itch is caused by fungi that thrive in warm, moist areas of the body.  Jock itch is often caused by the same organism that causes athlete's foot. The rash can spread from person to person with skin contact or from sharing contaminated towels or clothing. You can also spread an infection from the foot to groin by way of the hands or a towel.You're at greater risk of jock itch if you:
Are male.
Are a teen or young adult.
Wear underwear, jeans or other clothing that's tight.
Sweat heavily.
Have a weak immune system.
Have athlete's foot.
Tips for reducing the risk of jock itch include:
Stay dry. Keep the groin area and inner thighs dry by drying with a clean towel after showering or exercising. Dry your feet last to avoid spreading athlete's foot to the groin area.
Wear clean clothes. Change your underwear at least once a day or more often if you sweat a lot. It helps to wear underwear made of cotton or other fabric that breathes and keeps the skin drier. Wash workout clothes after each use.
Find the correct fit. Choose underwear, athletic supporters and sports uniforms that fit well. Tight-fitting clothes can chafe your skin and up the risk of jock itch. Try wearing boxer shorts rather than briefs.
Don't share personal items. Don't let others use your clothing, towels or other personal items. Don't borrow such items from others.
Treat or prevent athlete's foot. Control athlete's foot to prevent its spread to the groin. Prevent athlete's foot by wearing waterproof footwear around public pools and in showers and locker rooms.

Symptoms may vary, depending on which organs are affected.Signs and symptoms of amyloidosis may include:
Severe fatigue and weakness
Shortness of breath
Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet
Swelling of the ankles and legs
Diarrhea, possibly with blood, or constipation
An enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge
Skin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and purplish patches around the eyes
See your health care provider if you regularly experience any of the signs or symptoms associated with amyloidosis.There are many different types of amyloidosis. Some types are hereditary. Others are caused by outside factors, such as inflammatory diseases or long-term dialysis. Many types affect multiple organs. Others affect only one part of the body.Types of amyloidosis include:
AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis). This is the most common type of amyloidosis in developed countries. AL amyloidosis is also called primary amyloidosis. It usually affects the heart, kidneys, liver and nerves.
AA amyloidosis. This type is also known as secondary amyloidosis. It's usually triggered by an inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It most commonly affects the kidneys, liver and spleen.
Hereditary amyloidosis (familial amyloidosis). This inherited disorder often affects the nerves, heart and kidneys. It most commonly happens when a protein made by your liver is abnormal. This protein is called transthyretin (TTR).
Wild-type amyloidosis. This variety has also been called senile systemic amyloidosis. It occurs when the TTR protein made by the liver is normal but produces amyloid for unknown reasons. Wild-type amyloidosis tends to affect men over age 70 and often targets the heart. It can also cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
Localized amyloidosis. This type of amyloidosis often has a better prognosis than the varieties that affect multiple organ systems. Typical sites for localized amyloidosis include the bladder, skin, throat or lungs. Correct diagnosis is important so that treatments that affect the entire body can be avoided.
Factors that increase the risk of amyloidosis include:
Age. Most people diagnosed with amyloidosis are between ages 60 and 70.
Sex. Amyloidosis occurs more commonly in men.
Other diseases. Having a chronic infectious or inflammatory disease increases the risk of AA amyloidosis.
Family history. Some types of amyloidosis are hereditary.
Kidney dialysis. Dialysis can't always remove large proteins from the blood. If you're on dialysis, abnormal proteins can build up in your blood and eventually be deposited in tissue. This condition is less common with more modern dialysis techniques.
Race. People of African descent appear to be at higher risk of carrying a genetic mutation associated with a type of amyloidosis that can harm the heart.
Amyloidosis can seriously damage the:
Heart. Amyloid reduces the heart's ability to fill with blood between heartbeats. Less blood is pumped with each beat. This can cause shortness of breath. If amyloidosis affects the heart's electrical system, it can cause heart rhythm problems. Amyloid-related heart problems can become life-threatening.
Kidneys. Amyloid can harm the kidneys' filtering system. This affects their ability to remove waste products from the body. It can eventually cause kidney failure.
Nervous system. Nerve damage can cause pain, numbness, or tingling of the fingers and feet. If amyloid affects the nerves that control bowel function, it can cause periods of alternating constipation and diarrhea. Damage to the nerves that control blood pressure can make people feel faint if they stand up too quickly.

Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity.Signs and symptoms include:
Flat, light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spots are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing.
Freckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling usually appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds.
Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.
Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age.
Bone deformities. Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg.
Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumors usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults.
Learning disabilities. Impaired thinking skills are common in children who have NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.
Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.
Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height.
Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Also known as vestibular schwannomas, these tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain.Signs and symptoms generally appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms can include:
Gradual hearing loss
Ringing in the ears
Poor balance
Headaches
Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. People who have NF2 may also develop other benign tumors.Signs and symptoms of these tumors can include:
Numbness and weakness in the arms or legs
Pain
Balance difficulties
Facial drop
Vision problems or cataracts 
Seizures
Headache
This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between ages 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis causes tumors to develop on the cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves â€” but rarely on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, so people who have schwannomatosis don't experience the same hearing loss as people who have NF2.Symptoms of schwannomatosis include:
Chronic pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling
Numbness or weakness in various parts of the body
Loss of muscle
See your doctor if you or your child develop signs or symptoms of neurofibromatosis. The tumors associated with neurofibromatosis are often benign and slow growing.Neurofibromatosis is caused by genetic defects (mutations) that either are passed on by a parent or occur spontaneously at conception. The specific genes involved depend on the type of neurofibromatosis:
NF1. The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17. This gene produces a protein called neurofibromin that helps regulate cell growth. The mutated gene causes a loss of neurofibromin, which allows cells to grow uncontrolled.
NF2. The NF2 gene is located on chromosome 22, and produces a protein called merlin (also called schwannomin), which suppresses tumors. The mutated gene causes a loss of merlin, leading to uncontrolled cell growth.
Schwannomatosis. So far, two genes are known to cause schwannomatosis. Mutations of the genes SMARCB1 and LZTR1, which suppress tumors, are associated with this type of neurofibromatosis.
The biggest risk factor for neurofibromatosis is a family history of the disorder. About half of people who have NF1 and NF2 inherited the disease from an affected parent. People who have NF1 and NF2 and whose relatives aren't affected are likely to have a new gene mutation.NF1 and NF2 are both autosomal dominant disorders, meaning that any child of a parent who is affected by the disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic mutation.The inheritance pattern for schwannomatosis is less clear. Researchers currently estimate that the risk of inheriting schwannomatosis from an affected parent is about 15%.Complications of neurofibromatosis vary, even within the same family. Generally, complications result from tumors that affect nerve tissue or press on internal organs.Complications of NF1 include:
Neurological problems. Learning and thinking difficulties are the most common neurological problems associated with NF1. Uncommon complications include epilepsy and the buildup of excess fluid in the brain.
Concerns with appearance. Visible signs of neurofibromatosis â€” such as extensive cafe au lait spots, many neurofibromas in the facial area or large neurofibromas â€” can cause anxiety and emotional distress, even if they're not medically serious.
Skeletal problems. Some children have abnormally formed bones, which can result in bowing of the legs and fractures that sometimes don't heal. NF1 can cause curvature of the spine (scoliosis) that may need bracing or surgery. NF1 is also associated with decreased bone mineral density, which increases the risk of weak bones (osteoporosis).
Vision problems. Sometimes a tumor develops on the optic nerve (optic glioma), which can affect vision.
Problems during times of hormonal change. Hormonal changes associated with puberty or pregnancy might cause an increase in neurofibromas. Most women who have NF1 have healthy pregnancies but will likely need monitoring by an obstetrician who is familiar with the disorder.
Cardiovascular problems. People who have NF1 have an increased risk of high blood pressure and may develop blood vessel abnormalities.
Breathing problems. Rarely, plexiform neurofibromas can put pressure on the airway.
Cancer. An estimated 3% to 5% of people who have NF1 develop cancerous tumors. These usually arise from neurofibromas under the skin or from plexiform neurofibromas. People who have NF1 also have a higher risk of other forms of cancer, such as breast cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer, brain tumors and some types of soft tissue cancer. Women who have NF1 should start screening for breast cancer at an earlier age than the general population.
Benign adrenal gland tumor (pheochromocytoma). This noncancerous tumor secretes hormones that raise your blood pressure. Surgery is usually needed to remove the pheochromocytoma.
Complications of NF2 include: 
Partial or total deafness
Facial nerve damage
Vision problems
Small benign skin tumors (skin schwannomas)
Weakness or numbness in the extremities
Multiple benign brain tumors or spinal tumors (meningiomas) requiring frequent surgeries
The pain caused by schwannomatosis can be debilitating and may require surgical treatment or management by a pain specialist.

But any part of the body can be affected. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the size or location of the growths.Although symptoms are different for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include:
Skin changes. Skin changes are most common. These include patches of lighter skin and small areas of thickened, smooth or bumpy skin. On the forehead, skin can have raised, discolored areas. Small soft bumps under or around the nails may occur. Growths on the face that start in childhood and look like acne are common.
Seizures. Growths in the brain may be linked with seizures. A seizure is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm involves stiffening of the arms and legs and arching the back and head.
Problems in thinking, reasoning and learning. Tuberous sclerosis can result in developmental delays. Sometimes it limits the ability to think, reason and learn. Mental health conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also can occur.
Behavior problems. Common behavior problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment.
Kidney problems. Growths on the kidneys are common, and more growths may develop with age.
Heart issues. Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as a child gets older.
Lung problems. Growths that develop in the lungs may cause coughing or trouble breathing, especially with physical activity or exercise. These lung tumors occur more often in females than in males.
Eye problems. Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. These growths usually don't interfere with vision.
Dental changes. Teeth may have pits in the surface. Small growths may appear on the gums, inside of the cheeks and on the tongue.
Symptoms of tuberous sclerosis may be noticed at birth. Or the first symptoms may appear during childhood or even years later in adulthood.Contact your child's health care provider if you're concerned about your child's development or you notice any symptoms of tuberous sclerosis.Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder caused by gene changes â€” sometimes called mutations â€” in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene. These genes are thought to prevent cells from growing too fast or in an out-of-control way. Changes in either of these genes can cause cells to grow and divide more than needed. This leads to multiple growths throughout the body. These growths are considered noncancerous tumors.Tuberous sclerosis can be the result of either:
A random cell division error. About two-thirds of people who have tuberous sclerosis have a new change in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene linked with tuberous sclerosis. Most people do not have a family history of tuberous sclerosis.
A gene change passed down in families. About one-third of people who have tuberous sclerosis get a changed TSC1 or TSC2 gene from a parent who has the disorder.
If you have tuberous sclerosis, you have up to a 50% chance of passing the changed gene and the disorder to your biological children, which means children related to you by blood may inherit that gene. How bad the disorder gets may vary. A parent with tuberous sclerosis may have a child who has a milder or a more severe form of the disorder.Depending on where the noncancerous tumors grow and their size, they can cause severe or life-threatening complications. Here are some examples:
Too much fluid in and around the brain. One type of noncancerous brain growth, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, can grow along the lining of the fluid-filled spaces in the brain, called ventricles. The tumor can block the flow of fluid that helps protect the brain, causing fluid to build up around the brain. This buildup is called hydrocephalus. Symptoms can include a head size that is larger than expected, nausea, headaches and behavior changes.
Heart complications. Growths in the heart, usually in infants, can block blood flow or cause problems with heart rhythm.
Kidney damage. Growths in the kidney can be large and cause potentially serious â€” even life-threatening â€” kidney problems. Growths in the kidney can cause high blood pressure or bleeding or lead to kidney failure. Rarely, kidney growths can become cancerous.
Lung failure. Growths in the lungs damage the lung tissue and can lead to collapsed lungs. The growths interfere with how well the lungs can provide oxygen to the rest of the body.
Increased risk of cancerous tumors. Tuberous sclerosis is linked with an increased risk of developing cancerous tumors in the kidneys and brain.
Vision damage. Growths in the eye can interfere with vision if they block too much of the retina, though this is rare.

If you know what to look for, you can also find warning signs of heart disease on your skin and nails. The following pictures show you what to look for.Swelling in your feet and lower legs




What it may be telling you: Your heart isnâ€™t working properly.

Many diseases of the heart cause fluid to build up in your feet and lower legs. As the fluid builds up, you may see swelling, which can extend as far as the upper legs and groin.
Medical name: Edema (medical term for swelling)Blue or purple color on your skin
What it may be telling you: You have a blockage in a blood vessel.
    





When youâ€™re extremely cold, your skin can turn blue (or purple). If an area of your skin is blue (or purple) when youâ€™re warm, thatâ€™s can be a sign your blood isnâ€™t getting enough oxygen. The patient in this photo has a condition known as blue toe syndrome, which happens when one or more blood vessels are blocked.

Without treatment, the lack of oxygen can cause the skin and underlying tissue to eventually die.
Medical name: Cyanosis (refers to the bluish color on the skin)Blue or purple net-like pattern on your skin
What it may be telling you: You have a blocked artery.
    





Some people see this pattern on their skin when they feel chilly. When their skin warms up, this pattern disappears. Itâ€™s also possible to see this pattern when taking certain medications. If one of these is causing the netlike pattern, itâ€™s usually nothing to worry about.

This netlike pattern can also be a sign of a disease called cholesterol embolization syndrome, which occurs when small arteries become blocked. The blockage can lead to damaged tissues and organs, so itâ€™s important to see a doctor to find out whether you have an undiagnosed disease.
Medical name: Livedo reticularis (medical term for the net-like pattern)Yellowish-orange, waxy growths on your skin
What it may be telling you: You have unhealthy cholesterol levels.
    





If you see yellowish-orange growths on your skin, you may have deposits of cholesterol under your skin. These painless deposits can appear in many areas, including the corners of your eyes, lines on your palms, or the backs of your lower legs.

If you notice these growths on any area of your skin, see your doctor. You may need cholesterol testing or another medical test.  Unhealthy cholesterol levels require treatment, which can prevent life-threatening heart disease. Getting your cholesterol levels under control may also help clear the growths on your skin. If the growths donâ€™t clear, a board-certified dermatologist can treat them.
Medical name: Xanthelasma (cholesterol deposits on the eyelids), Xanthoma (cholesterol deposit found elsewhere on the skin)Clusters of waxy bumps that suddenly appear on your skin
What it may be telling you: You have skyrocketing cholesterol levels or diabetes.
    




The sudden appearance of these bumps can look like a rash, warts, or a contagious skin condition called molluscum contagiosum. These bumps are actually fatty deposits of cholesterol caused by extremely high levels of triglycerides (type of cholesterol) in the blood.

Treatment is essential to lower the triglycerides and treat any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease caused by the high cholesterol levels.
Medical name: Eruptive xanthoma (refers to the sudden appearance of many fatty deposits of cholesterol)Nails curve downward and the ends of your fingers are swollen




What it may be telling you: You may have a heart infection, heart disease, or lung problem.

For many people, these signs are harmless. That said, if your fingers and nails look like this, itâ€™s best to find out if you may have a medical condition, such as lung disease or a heart problem.
Medical name: Clubbing (term describes the downward turned nails and swollen fingers)Red or purple lines under your nails




What it may be telling you: Most people who see these lines under their nails have injured the nail in some way. If you cannot remember injuring your nail, you may want to see your doctor. These lines can be a sign of heart disease or another condition.

When itâ€™s a sign of heart disease, people tend to have symptoms, such as high fever and a weak or irregular heartbeat.
Medical name: Splinter hemorrhage (line often looks like a splinter stuck under the nail)Smooth, waxy lumps on your skin




What it may be telling you: You have protein deposits in your heart or another organ.

These waxy lumps can appear anywhere on the skin. They often indicate that thereâ€™s an abnormal buildup of protein in an organ, such as your heart. If protein builds up in the heart, itâ€™s hard for the heart to work properly.
Medical name: Nodules of systemic amyloidosis (â€œnoduleâ€ means lump and amyloidosis refers to the type of protein that has built up)Painful lumps in your fingers, toes, or both





What it may be telling you: You have an infection in your heart or blood vessels.

If you have a heart infection known as infective endocarditis, these painful lumps can develop in your fingers, toes, or both places. The lumps can last for a few hours to several days.

While the lumps go away on their own, patients need treatment for the infection. Because this infection is caused by bacteria, antibiotics can often treat it. Sometimes, surgery is also necessary.
Medical name: Osler nodes. A doctor named Osler discovered the connection between a patient having these lumps, which are now called Osler nodes, and a heart infection.Brownish (or reddish) discoloration, usually on your sole(s) or palm(s)




What it may be telling you: You have an infection in your heart or blood vessel.

The spots that developed on the bottom of this patientâ€™s foot are also a sign of a heart infection called infective endocarditis. Unlike Osler nodules, these spots are painless. These spots will clear without treatment, usually in a few days or weeks. The infection requires treatment.
Medical name: Janeway lesions, which are named after an American doctor, Theodore Caldwell Janeway.Non-itchy rash (flat spots with slightly raised edges) and fever





What it may be telling you: You have rheumatic fever.

If your child develops strep throat, treating it quickly is important. When itâ€™s not treated quickly, other medical problems can develop. One such problem is rheumatic fever. While this seldom happens in the United States today, rheumatic fever is common in developing countries.

When a child has rheumatic fever, it can lead to lifelong heart disease. Rheumatic fever is a leading cause of heart disease in children.
Medical name: Erythema marginatum (name of the rash shown in this picture)Rash and cracked, swollen lips that often bleed




What it may be telling you: A child has Kawasaki disease.

When a child has a rash, fever, and extremely dry lips that may crack and bleed, Kawasaki disease is a likely cause. This disease, which affects the blood vessels, usually develops in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years of age.

While Kawasaki disease may go away on its own within 12 days without treatment, it can lead to serious side effects, such as heart disease.
Medical name: Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (another name for Kawasaki disease)Other signs that appear on the skin and can be a warning sign of heart disease, include:A gray ring around the colored part of your eyeChanges to your tongue, such as it swelling and turning red as a strawberryDiscolored skinIf you notice any of these signs, make an appointment to see your primary doctor and try to stay calm. The sign could be harmless, but itâ€™s important to get it checked out. Heart disease is easier to treat when found early.Images

0,Light Diseases and Disorders of Pigmentation,Albinism,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184,"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:
Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).
Sunburn and no ability to tan.
For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:
Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.
An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.
Legal blindness â€” vision less than 20/200 â€” or complete blindness.
At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision.If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider.Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes.Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.Types of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected.
Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene â€” one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. OCA is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from OCA1 to OCA8. OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.
Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than OCA.
Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes can occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.
Albinism can include skin and eye complications. It also can include social and emotional challenges.Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive.People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced.Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition.People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress.Using the term ""person with albinism"" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. The counselor can explain the available genetic tests.

The color varies with a personâ€™s skin tone and the severity of the melasma. In general, melasma is slightly darker than your natural skin color. Most people see various shades of brown. Melasma can look bluish gray in people with darker skin tones.The following pictures show what melasma can look like. This woman has melasma on her cheek, chin, above her upper lip, and next to her ear.If you have melasma on your cheeks, youâ€™ll see patches or spots on both cheeks, as shown here. This woman also has melasma on her nose, chin, and above her upper lip.The unevenly shaped patches of melasma can join together, creating one or more large areas of melasma.This womanâ€™s melasma is most noticeable along her jawline. When melasma appears along the jawline, it may be a sign that the skin has been badly damaged by the sunâ€™s rays.You may see patches like those shown here on the sides of this womanâ€™s face, chin, and above her eyes.The light brown patch in the center of this personâ€™s forehead is melasma.While less common, melasma can develop on the arms, as shown here. Regardless of where melasma appears on your skin, it tends to become more noticeable when you spend time in the sun. Protecting your skin from the sun can help fade dark patches and spots.While melasma primarily affects women, some men develop melasma. This man has melasma in common places like his cheeks, chin, forehead, and above his upper lip.While this skin condition can be noticeable, you wonâ€™t feel anything on your skin. Melasma wonâ€™t make your skin itch or cause pain.While your skin doesnâ€™t feel different, melasma can take a toll on your emotions. Having melasma makes some people feel self-conscious. Studies show melasma can lower self-esteem because it affects your appearance.If you dislike the way melasma looks, treatment can help. Any treatment plan for melasma will include sun protection. Thatâ€™s because the sunâ€™s rays play a role in causing melasma.To see what else may play a role in causing these patches and spots, go to Melasma: Causes.Images

Itâ€™s the reason we tan and sunburn. Itâ€™s why freckles, age spots, and skin cancers appear.Some people are born more sun sensitive than others. People who have an extreme sensitivity to sunlight are born with a rare disease known as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). They must take extreme measures to protect their skin from ultraviolet (UV) light. Anything that emits UV light, including the sun and some lightbulbs, can damage their skin.When people with XP go outdoors during daylight, they need to cover up. Dermatologists recommend that they wear clothing which offers maximum protection from UV light. To protect their face and eyes, they should put on UV-protective sunglasses, goggles, or a face shield. Beneath this outer protective layer, they have on sunscreen, which is necessary should any skin become uncovered.When you have a rare disease called XP, you must take extreme precautions to protect your skin from the sun.People who have XP need this extreme protection because their bodies cannot protect them from UV light. This happens because they inherit genes that prevent their bodies from repairing damage caused by UV light.Because the body cannot protect itself from UV light, a personâ€™s risk of getting skin cancer skyrockets. Itâ€™s estimated that XP can raise the risk of getting skin cancer 10,000-fold.Most children who have XP develop skin cancer before reaching 10 years of age. At an even younger age, these children can have pre-cancerous growths on their skin.Skin cancers and pre-cancerous growths develop because it takes time to diagnose XP. You cannot look at a newborn and tell that the child has XP.This disease tends to reveal itself when a child spends time outdoors. Some children develop a serious sunburn the first time daylight hits their skin. Not all children who have XP sunburn so easily.For many children, the first noticeable sign of XP is many freckles on their skin, which usually develop before the child is 2 years old. As the child spends time in the sun, larger dark spots also appear. The skin will also feel extremely dry.Itâ€™s these warning signs that give the disease its name. The word â€œxerodermaâ€ means extremely dry skin and â€œpigmentosumâ€ refers to the freckles and dark spots.People who have XP may also develop eye problems. Sunlight can cause cancers to form on their eyes or eyelids. Cataracts and other eye problems may also arise.By 13 years of age, freckles blanket her skin and skin cancer appears on her leg.If you suspect that your child may have XP, itâ€™s important to find out. Anyone who has XP needs extreme sun protection and expert medical care. You never outgrow XP.To get an accurate diagnosis, people are usually referred to a board-certified dermatologist. If the diagnosis is XP, working with a dermatologist helps to:Reduce the risk of getting skin cancersFind and treat skin cancers early before the cancer spreadsCoordinate care with other health care professionalsSeeing other health care professionals is usually necessary because people who have XP can develop related health problems. These problems include possible troubles with eyesight, hearing loss, and spastic muscles.Coping with all of this may sound difficult, but it hasnâ€™t stopped Aimee Milota, a teenager who has XP. Sheâ€™s an active teenager, living life to the fullest. You can read Aimeeâ€™s story at, Living with extreme chronic skin cancer risk.To improve the lives of their patients with XP, dermatologists continue to study this disease. Their work has led to:Improvements in sun protectionThe discovery of medications that can reduce the risk of developing skin cancersInsight into how skin cancer develops and can be preventedThis research can help everyone, not only their patients with XP. We all have sun-sensitive skin. Every year, millions of Americans develop skin cancer.While people who have XP require extreme sun protection, everyone can benefit from sun protection. For most people, skin cancer is preventable.You can find out how to protect your skin at, Prevent skin cancer.Images

Symptoms also can vary among people with the condition. Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms.Acute porphyrias include forms of the disease that usually cause nervous system symptoms. A few forms also can affect the skin. Symptoms appear quickly and can be severe. Symptoms may last hours, days or weeks.The most common form of acute porphyria is called acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP may last hours or days. Intermittent means that the symptoms may go away but return later. When the symptoms occur they are sometimes called attacks.Symptoms of acute porphyrias may include:
Severe pain in the belly, chest, legs or back.
Digestive problems, such as constipation, nausea and vomiting.
Muscle pain, tingling, numbness, weakness or paralysis.
Red or brown urine.
Mental changes, such as anxiety, hallucinations or mental confusion.
Rapid or irregular heartbeats you can feel, called palpitations.
Breathing problems.
High blood pressure.
Seizures.
Cutaneous porphyrias include forms of the disease that cause skin symptoms as a result of sensitivity to sunlight. These forms usually don't affect the nervous system. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of all the porphyrias.Sun exposure may cause:
Sensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain in the skin.
Sudden painful skin redness and swelling.
Blisters on exposed skin, usually the hands, arms and face.
Fragile thin skin with changes in skin color.
Itching.
Too much hair growth in affected areas.
Red or brown urine.
Erythropoietic protoporphyria (uh-rith-roe-poi-ET-ik pro-toe-por-FEAR-e-uh), also called EPP, is a rare type of cutaneous porphyria. It's the most common childhood porphyria. Sun or artificial light exposure quickly results in painful skin burning, irritation and swelling. Small bumps and blisters also appear. Repeated exposures can cause thick, leathery skin and scarring.Many symptoms of porphyria are like those of other, more common conditions. This can make it difficult to know if you're having an attack of porphyria. If you have symptoms that could be porphyria, get medical attention. Prompt treatment is important.All types of porphyria involve a problem making heme. Heme is a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Heme also plays a role in clearing drugs and hormones from the body.Heme is made in the bone marrow and liver. This process involves eight different enzymes that turn porphyrins into heme. A shortage or change in any of these enzymes causes a buildup of porphyrins. Which enzyme is affected determines the type of porphyria.In cutaneous porphyrias, porphyrins build up in the skin. When exposed to sunlight, they cause symptoms. In acute porphyrias, the buildup affects the nervous system, causing symptoms.Most forms of porphyria are caused by a gene change passed down from one or both parents. Porphyria can occur if you inherit:
A changed gene from one of your parents (autosomal dominant pattern).
Changed genes from both parents (autosomal recessive pattern).
Just because you inherit a gene or genes that can cause porphyria doesn't mean that you'll have symptoms. You might never have symptoms. This also is the case for most carriers of the changed genes.Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) usually is not passed down in families. In PCT, certain triggers can cause a buildup of porphyrins that may cause symptoms. Examples of triggers include:
Too much iron in the body, often due to a condition called hemochromatosis, which is caused by a gene change.
Viral infections, such as HIV or hepatitis C.
Heavy alcohol use.
Smoking.
Hormones changes during the menstrual period.
In addition to genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors may trigger symptoms in porphyria. When exposed to the trigger, the body's demand for heme production increases. This overwhelms the low level of a needed enzyme, setting in motion a process that causes a buildup of porphyrins.Examples of triggers include:
Exposure to sunlight.
Certain medicines, for example, birth control pills, sedatives and barbiturates.
Recreational or illicit drugs.
Dieting or fasting.
Smoking.
Physical stress, such as infections or other illnesses or surgery.
Emotional stress.
Alcohol use.
Hormone changes during the menstrual period.
Possible complications depend on the form of porphyria:
Acute porphyrias can be life-threatening if an attack isn't promptly treated. During an attack, you may experience dehydration from loss of fluids, breathing problems, seizures or high blood pressure. You may need a stay in the hospital for treatment. Long-term complications with repeat acute attacks may include long-term pain, chronic kidney failure, liver damage or liver cancer.
Cutaneous porphyrias can result in permanent skin damage. And the skin blisters can become infected. When your skin heals after symptoms, it may have a changed appearance and coloring, be fragile and slow to heal, or leave scars. Cutaneous porphyrias also increase the risk of liver damage or liver cancer.
In rare cases, a bone marrow transplant or liver transplant may be needed.Although there's no way to prevent porphyria, if you have the condition, avoid triggers to help prevent symptoms.Because porphyria is usually an inherited disorder, your siblings and other family members may want to consider genetic testing to determine if they have the condition. Genetic counseling is important to help understand test results and risks.

When vitiligo begins, the patches usually appear on the: FaceArmsHandsFeetIn time, the spots and patches can grow, and vitiligo can appear on other areas of a personâ€™s body. Some people lose color in areas called mucous membranes, which includes the inside of the mouth or nose and the genitals.Vitiligo can also affect the hair, causing white or prematurely gray hair.Some people lose some of their eye color and see light spots on the colored part of an eye. Vitiligo can also develop inside your ear and may affect your hearing.The most noticeable sign of vitiligo is one or more areas of lighter skin. For many people, thatâ€™s the only sign of vitiligo. However, other signs and symptoms can develop. The following explains what you may notice.When a person has vitiligo, cells that make pigment are damaged. Because these cells give the skin its color, spots and patches of lighter skin appear. Vitiligo can appear anywhere on a personâ€™s skin, including the genitals.When vitiligo is actively destroying cells that give a personâ€™s skin its color, the patches tend to be pink or tricolor (causing a zone of tan skin between a personâ€™s natural skin color and the white vitiligo). Once vitiligo is no longer active, the patches turn completely white, as shown here.Vitiligo can  cause loss of color in the mouth, on the lips, around the mouth, around the nose, or inside the nose.Skin thatâ€™s lost pigment is more sensitive to sunlight, so it sunburns quickly. Sunburns can also trigger vitiligo, causing it to spread. Thatâ€™s why sun protection is so important.When vitiligo is actively spreading, patches may feel itchy. Otherwise, the spots and patches rarely cause discomfort.Vitiligo can cause a personâ€™s hair to lose its color. When vitiligo appears on the skin, the hair in that area can turn white, as shown in picture A. Vitiligo can also cause a personâ€™s hair to turn prematurely gray, as shown in picture B.Some people develop loss of color on part (or all) of an eyelash or eyebrow. Others see a streak of white hair on their head.Melanocytes are the cells that give skin, hair, and eyes their color. The inner ear also contains these cells. When a person has vitiligo, the body attacks melanocytes. If the body attacks melanocytes in the inner ear, a person can have hearing loss.If vitiligo affects the eyes, your eye color could change. This happens quickly. While rare, vitiligo can also affect a personâ€™s eyesight.Vitiligo can change your appearance, which leaves some people feeling:Self-consciousAnxiousDepressedAngryEmbarrassedFrustratedIf vitiligo affects the way you feel about yourself, youâ€™re not alone. In talking with their patients, dermatologists have learned that vitiligo often changes how people feel about themselves.Many patients want to hide vitiligo. One woman confided that she wanted to wear a short-sleeved dress to a wedding but didnâ€™t. She was too worried about what others would think when they saw the light patches on her skin.If vitiligo affects the way you feel about yourself and life, tell your dermatologist. With help, many people feel better. Help can range from treatment that may restore lost skin color to learning how to get natural-looking results from camouflage makeup. For some patients, joining a support group or seeing a psychologist helps build their self-confidence.Learning more about this disease can also be helpful. Some people say it helps them feel more in control. To learn why some people get vitiligo, go to Vitiligo: Causes.Is vitiligo a medical condition?Vitiligo discomfort stops with sunscreen useImages

Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is often called the â€œitch that rashes.â€ This description explains what happens when the condition begins. It tends to start suddenly with very itchy skin. Scratching the itchy skin often causes a rash. A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:Itchy skinDry, scaly areasRed rash (especially on lighter skin tones)Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)Scratch marksRaw skin from scratchingBumps or rashes leaking fluidBlisters that ooze and crust overAfter healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had  atopic dermatitisFlare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:Thickened, scaly, and leatheryCrackedWhen this happens, you may see more lines on your hands, as shown here, or feet.Thickened skin tends to itch most of the time. Treating atopic dermatitis before the skin thickens can help prevent thickened, itchy skin.Where atopic dermatitis develops on the body tends to vary with age. The signs can also differ with race. The following pictures of atopic dermatitis show what you may see.While atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere, babies and young children often develop it on their cheeks, forehead, or scalp. Flare-ups can later also appear on the trunk, legs, or arms. On lighter skin tones, you often see a red rash with bumps (A). Children with darker skin tones may have several bumps with or without redness and darker areas of skin, like on this boyâ€™s forehead (B).Atopic dermatitis is intensely itchy. When babies have itchy skin, they rub against something. The rubbing can cause bumps, which can ooze and then crust over.You may see dry, scaly skin on any area of your babyâ€™s body. If your baby often rubs up against objects to relieve the itch of the dry, scaly skin, your baby may develop raw skin.The discomfort caused by the itch, rash, and dry skin can cause your baby to act fussy or have trouble sleeping. Lack of sleep is common in anyone who has atopic dermatitis, including babies and young children.As children grow and develop, atopic dermatitis often changes. Hereâ€™s what you may see.Between 2 years of age and puberty, the condition often affects these areas of the body. Children with lighter skin tones often develop an itchy rash in the creases of their elbows or backs of their knees. If your child has a darker skin tone, patches tend to form on the fronts of the knees, elbows, and backs of their hands. Other common places for atopic dermatitis to appear are the neck, wrists, and ankles. Children with brown or black skin are more likely than white children to have atopic dermatitis on their trunk.These creases, which are called Dennie-Morgan folds, also develop in people who have asthma or hay fever.Older children and teenagers may have small, itchy bumps on their skin instead of a weepy rash. Scratching can cause the spots to leak fluid and then crust over. On darker skin tones, the bumps tend to be gray to violet-brown in color.Skin that is constantly rubbed or scratched can thicken. This helps protect the skin. Thickened skin is often excessively dry and itches most of the time.Atopic dermatitis usually begins early in life and may go away during childhood or the teen years. Some people continue to have this condition as adults. Itâ€™s also possible for atopic dermatitis to begin when youâ€™re an adult.In adults, atopic dermatitis can take many forms. For some people, the condition looks the same as when they were a child or teenager. Adults may also develop the following:Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis on their hands. In fact, the hands may be the only place adults have the condition.Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis around their eyes. Youâ€™ll often see thickened skin thatâ€™s darker than the surrounding skin.If youâ€™ve had  atopic dermatitis for years, patches of your skin may have permanently thickened and developed a leathery texture, as shown here. This is caused by years of scratching. The affected skin also tends to look darker (or lighter) than the surrounding skin. The thickened skin can itch all the time, even when you donâ€™t have a flare-up.Discolored, extremely dry, and itchy skin: Adults may develop discolored skin thatâ€™s extremely dry and easily irritated. This often develops on the hands or feet, but it can occur anywhere. Some adults have nipple eczema, which can be itchy and painful. The dry, cracked skin and scratching make the skin more susceptible to infection. Infections that people with  atopic dermatitis can develop include: Yellow or golden crusts on the skin, like the ones above this childâ€™s lip, often indicate a staph infection. If you see golden or yellowish crusts, contact your dermatologistâ€™s office.Molluscum contagiosum: Having atopic dermatitis increases the risk of getting this common viral infection, which causes small bumps on the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, dermatologists often recommend treating molluscum, especially if it triggers a flare-up of atopic dermatitis.Eczema herpeticum: This is a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms include dome-shaped blisters and bumps, along with fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In children, babies, and anyone who is immunocompromised, eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care.Many studies find that having atopic dermatitis can cause people to feel anxious, depressed, or both. This is often due to the itch, pain, and problems sleeping. These feelings can also be triggered by flare-ups. Some people say they feel ashamed when others see flare-ups on their skin.When people feel anxious or depressed, they often spend more time alone. This can cause people to feel isolated.While studying atopic dermatitis, researchers have also discovered that some people are more likely than others to develop it.

You can develop contact dermatitis on any part of your skin that touches something which either irritates your skin or causes an allergic reaction. Because we touch most things with our hands, contact dermatitis often develops here.If you have an allergy to fragrance, which is common, you may develop contact dermatitis where you apply a personal care product. The face, neck, underarms, scalp, and tops of feet are also common places to develop contact dermatitis. However, contact dermatitis can appear anywhere on your skin.When signs and symptoms appear, you may have:Itchy skin (often intense)Rash (skin discolored, swollen, and hot)Excessively dry skin that may crack Tender skinBurning or stinging Hives (round welts on the skin that itch intensely)Fluid-filled blistersOozing blisters that leave crusts and scalesThese pictures of contact dermatitis show you what this skin disease can look like. Before the rash appears, you may feel an intense itch, burning sensation, or pain. These symptoms often continue after the rash appears.This man developed contact dermatitis after using a spice-scented deodorant. The itchy rash cleared soon after he stopped applying the deodorant.The product that causes contact dermatitis doesnâ€™t have to touch your skin for long. This woman had an allergic reaction to shampoo, which only touched her eyelid when she rinsed it off in the shower. Because the skin on the eyelid is thinner than elsewhere, this is a common place for contact dermatitis to develop.Poison ivy caused the rash of itchy bumps and fluid-filled blisters shown here. Many people develop an allergic reaction on their skin when it touches poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac.This woman was working with fiberglass, which irritated her skin and caused the painful sores.If the sores break open, they can leak fluid. The sores shown here are due to severely irritated skin caused by handling fish.By seeing a dermatologist, this woman discovered her constantly itchy rash and swollen skin were caused by a product that contained oil of bergamot. When the oil on her skin reacted with sunlight, this rash appeared.If you only occasionally touch whatâ€™s causing contact dermatitis, the rash can come and go. Because an allergic reaction can take time to appear, it can take a bit of detective work to figure out whatâ€™s causing the rash. By seeing a dermatologist, this woman discovered that she has a nickel allergy. The necklace shown in this picture contains nickel, which is causing her rash.Jewelry often contains nickel. This metal is also found in cell phones, laptops, and other tech devices.If you continue to touch whatâ€™s causing the contact dermatitis, your skin often thickens, becomes scaly, and develops deep cracks. This usually happens when someone needs to work with chemicals, such as hair dyes, cement, or solvents. The long-standing contact dermatitis shown here appears on the hand of a massage therapist who uses essential oils to treat clients.While contact dermatitis often develops on the hands, it can appear anywhere on your skin, including feet, lips, or groin area. Sometimes, the cause never directly touches your skin. For example, shoes can cause an allergic reaction on feet covered by socks.Other times, the skin next to something that causes an allergic reaction may not rash. You may develop the rash elsewhere. For example, some people develop an allergic reaction to chemicals used in nail polish or artificial nails. Instead of developing a rash on their hands or feet, some people get a rash on their eyelids. The skin around the eye is thin. If youâ€™re allergic to something on your fingers, such as an ingredient in a nail polish, briefly touching the skin around the eye could cause a rash.This man developed a serious allergic reaction to a resin in his shoes.The rash around this womanâ€™s eye was caused by an allergic reaction to her artificial nails.While rare, the rash on a personâ€™s skin can also be caused by something inside their body. For example, some people develop an allergic reaction to a metal in an artificial hip or knee. A few patients have developed an allergic reaction to their pacemaker.Find out if you have an increased risk of developing contact dermatitis by going to, Contact dermatitis: Causes.Images

AD can develop on your eyelids and around your eyes, causing itchy skin and red, swollen eyes.If your eyes have felt this way for some time, you may pay little attention to eye problems. You should. Treatment can help you feel more comfortable, and possibly save your eyesight.Found early and treated, most eye problems linked to atopic dermatitis can be successfully treated.A board-certified dermatologist can create a custom-made treatment plan that helps your eyes feel more comfortable. Your dermatologist can also refer you to an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) if you have signs of an eye disease. Some adults who have AD have a higher risk of developing certain eye diseases.It seems that the more severe the AD, the higher your risk of developing certain eye diseases. At least, thatâ€™s the finding from a 15-year study run in Denmark.During this study, researchers looked at the medical records of adults in Denmark. In doing so, they discovered that those with AD had a higher risk of developing an eye infection called conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye.Pink eyeÂ (conjunctivitis): Signs that you may have pink eye include:Pink (or red) color to your eyeWatery, itchy eyesEyes sensitive to lightWet, sticky or dry, crusty eyesIn this study, adults with AD also had a higher risk of developing the following eye diseases.Inflamed corneaÂ (keratitis): This eye disease occurs when the eye becomes infected or inflamed. Warning signs include your eyes feeling:Painful or uncomfortableSensitive to lightAs if you have something in themGrittyWateryWhen caught early and properly treated, keratitis can often be cured.The cornea of the eye is normally round, as shown here.Frequently rubbing your eyes can change the shape of your cornea. As the cornea starts to change shape, it begins to bulge. It becomes cone-shaped. This change in shape can cause the following warning signs:If you have any warning signs of keratoconus, ask your eye doctor to take a close look at the shape of your cornea.When found and treated early, you can minimize the effect this disease has on your eyesight. Unfortunately, many people who have this eye disease donâ€™t get diagnosed early enough. That can cause loss of eyesight.If you have AD, itâ€™s important to play close attention to your eyes. When an eye problem lasts more than a few days, make an appointment to see your dermatologist or eye doctor.You should also have eye exams as often as your eye doctor recommends. Ophthalmologists are the experts at diagnosing eye disease. Caught early, the eye diseases linked to AD are highly treatable.Image

Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is often called the â€œitch that rashes.â€ This description explains what happens when the condition begins. It tends to start suddenly with very itchy skin. Scratching the itchy skin often causes a rash. A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:Itchy skinDry, scaly areasRed rash (especially on lighter skin tones)Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)Scratch marksRaw skin from scratchingBumps or rashes leaking fluidBlisters that ooze and crust overAfter healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had  atopic dermatitisFlare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:Thickened, scaly, and leatheryCrackedWhen this happens, you may see more lines on your hands, as shown here, or feet.Thickened skin tends to itch most of the time. Treating atopic dermatitis before the skin thickens can help prevent thickened, itchy skin.Where atopic dermatitis develops on the body tends to vary with age. The signs can also differ with race. The following pictures of atopic dermatitis show what you may see.While atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere, babies and young children often develop it on their cheeks, forehead, or scalp. Flare-ups can later also appear on the trunk, legs, or arms. On lighter skin tones, you often see a red rash with bumps (A). Children with darker skin tones may have several bumps with or without redness and darker areas of skin, like on this boyâ€™s forehead (B).Atopic dermatitis is intensely itchy. When babies have itchy skin, they rub against something. The rubbing can cause bumps, which can ooze and then crust over.You may see dry, scaly skin on any area of your babyâ€™s body. If your baby often rubs up against objects to relieve the itch of the dry, scaly skin, your baby may develop raw skin.The discomfort caused by the itch, rash, and dry skin can cause your baby to act fussy or have trouble sleeping. Lack of sleep is common in anyone who has atopic dermatitis, including babies and young children.As children grow and develop, atopic dermatitis often changes. Hereâ€™s what you may see.Between 2 years of age and puberty, the condition often affects these areas of the body. Children with lighter skin tones often develop an itchy rash in the creases of their elbows or backs of their knees. If your child has a darker skin tone, patches tend to form on the fronts of the knees, elbows, and backs of their hands. Other common places for atopic dermatitis to appear are the neck, wrists, and ankles. Children with brown or black skin are more likely than white children to have atopic dermatitis on their trunk.These creases, which are called Dennie-Morgan folds, also develop in people who have asthma or hay fever.Older children and teenagers may have small, itchy bumps on their skin instead of a weepy rash. Scratching can cause the spots to leak fluid and then crust over. On darker skin tones, the bumps tend to be gray to violet-brown in color.Skin that is constantly rubbed or scratched can thicken. This helps protect the skin. Thickened skin is often excessively dry and itches most of the time.Atopic dermatitis usually begins early in life and may go away during childhood or the teen years. Some people continue to have this condition as adults. Itâ€™s also possible for atopic dermatitis to begin when youâ€™re an adult.In adults, atopic dermatitis can take many forms. For some people, the condition looks the same as when they were a child or teenager. Adults may also develop the following:Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis on their hands. In fact, the hands may be the only place adults have the condition.Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis around their eyes. Youâ€™ll often see thickened skin thatâ€™s darker than the surrounding skin.If youâ€™ve had  atopic dermatitis for years, patches of your skin may have permanently thickened and developed a leathery texture, as shown here. This is caused by years of scratching. The affected skin also tends to look darker (or lighter) than the surrounding skin. The thickened skin can itch all the time, even when you donâ€™t have a flare-up.Discolored, extremely dry, and itchy skin: Adults may develop discolored skin thatâ€™s extremely dry and easily irritated. This often develops on the hands or feet, but it can occur anywhere. Some adults have nipple eczema, which can be itchy and painful. The dry, cracked skin and scratching make the skin more susceptible to infection. Infections that people with  atopic dermatitis can develop include: Yellow or golden crusts on the skin, like the ones above this childâ€™s lip, often indicate a staph infection. If you see golden or yellowish crusts, contact your dermatologistâ€™s office.Molluscum contagiosum: Having atopic dermatitis increases the risk of getting this common viral infection, which causes small bumps on the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, dermatologists often recommend treating molluscum, especially if it triggers a flare-up of atopic dermatitis.Eczema herpeticum: This is a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms include dome-shaped blisters and bumps, along with fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In children, babies, and anyone who is immunocompromised, eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care.Many studies find that having atopic dermatitis can cause people to feel anxious, depressed, or both. This is often due to the itch, pain, and problems sleeping. These feelings can also be triggered by flare-ups. Some people say they feel ashamed when others see flare-ups on their skin.When people feel anxious or depressed, they often spend more time alone. This can cause people to feel isolated.While studying atopic dermatitis, researchers have also discovered that some people are more likely than others to develop it.

A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:Itchy skinDry, scaly areasRed rash (especially on lighter skin tones)Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)Scratch marksRaw skin from scratchingBumps or rashes leaking fluidBlisters that ooze and crust overAfter healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had  atopic dermatitisFlare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:Thickened, scaly, and leatheryCrackedWhen this happens, you may see more lines on your hands, as shown here, or feet.Thickened skin tends to itch most of the time. Treating atopic dermatitis before the skin thickens can help prevent thickened, itchy skin.Where atopic dermatitis develops on the body tends to vary with age. The signs can also differ with race. The following pictures of atopic dermatitis show what you may see.While atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere, babies and young children often develop it on their cheeks, forehead, or scalp. Flare-ups can later also appear on the trunk, legs, or arms. On lighter skin tones, you often see a red rash with bumps (A). Children with darker skin tones may have several bumps with or without redness and darker areas of skin, like on this boyâ€™s forehead (B).Atopic dermatitis is intensely itchy. When babies have itchy skin, they rub against something. The rubbing can cause bumps, which can ooze and then crust over.You may see dry, scaly skin on any area of your babyâ€™s body. If your baby often rubs up against objects to relieve the itch of the dry, scaly skin, your baby may develop raw skin.The discomfort caused by the itch, rash, and dry skin can cause your baby to act fussy or have trouble sleeping. Lack of sleep is common in anyone who has atopic dermatitis, including babies and young children.As children grow and develop, atopic dermatitis often changes. Hereâ€™s what you may see.Between 2 years of age and puberty, the condition often affects these areas of the body. Children with lighter skin tones often develop an itchy rash in the creases of their elbows or backs of their knees. If your child has a darker skin tone, patches tend to form on the fronts of the knees, elbows, and backs of their hands. Other common places for atopic dermatitis to appear are the neck, wrists, and ankles. Children with brown or black skin are more likely than white children to have atopic dermatitis on their trunk.These creases, which are called Dennie-Morgan folds, also develop in people who have asthma or hay fever.Older children and teenagers may have small, itchy bumps on their skin instead of a weepy rash. Scratching can cause the spots to leak fluid and then crust over. On darker skin tones, the bumps tend to be gray to violet-brown in color.Skin that is constantly rubbed or scratched can thicken. This helps protect the skin. Thickened skin is often excessively dry and itches most of the time.Atopic dermatitis usually begins early in life and may go away during childhood or the teen years. Some people continue to have this condition as adults. Itâ€™s also possible for atopic dermatitis to begin when youâ€™re an adult.In adults, atopic dermatitis can take many forms. For some people, the condition looks the same as when they were a child or teenager. Adults may also develop the following:Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis on their hands. In fact, the hands may be the only place adults have the condition.Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis around their eyes. Youâ€™ll often see thickened skin thatâ€™s darker than the surrounding skin.If youâ€™ve had  atopic dermatitis for years, patches of your skin may have permanently thickened and developed a leathery texture, as shown here. This is caused by years of scratching. The affected skin also tends to look darker (or lighter) than the surrounding skin. The thickened skin can itch all the time, even when you donâ€™t have a flare-up.Discolored, extremely dry, and itchy skin: Adults may develop discolored skin thatâ€™s extremely dry and easily irritated. This often develops on the hands or feet, but it can occur anywhere. Some adults have nipple eczema, which can be itchy and painful. The dry, cracked skin and scratching make the skin more susceptible to infection. Infections that people with  atopic dermatitis can develop include: Yellow or golden crusts on the skin, like the ones above this childâ€™s lip, often indicate a staph infection. If you see golden or yellowish crusts, contact your dermatologistâ€™s office.Molluscum contagiosum: Having atopic dermatitis increases the risk of getting this common viral infection, which causes small bumps on the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, dermatologists often recommend treating molluscum, especially if it triggers a flare-up of atopic dermatitis.Eczema herpeticum: This is a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms include dome-shaped blisters and bumps, along with fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In children, babies, and anyone who is immunocompromised, eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care.Many studies find that having atopic dermatitis can cause people to feel anxious, depressed, or both. This is often due to the itch, pain, and problems sleeping. These feelings can also be triggered by flare-ups. Some people say they feel ashamed when others see flare-ups on their skin.When people feel anxious or depressed, they often spend more time alone. This can cause people to feel isolated.While studying atopic dermatitis, researchers have also discovered that some people are more likely than others to develop it.

If you have excessively dry skin, you may notice one or more of the following:Excessively dry skin has lost a lot of moisture, so itâ€™s noticeably dehydrated. Signs of dehydrated skin include dryness, more noticeable fine lines, and itch. When the skin loses enough moisture, it starts to flake off. This causes the rough texture.As the skin dries out, it shrinks. This shrinking causes cracks to form. Some cracks can become deep and may bleed.Some people who have excessively dry skin say their skin itches all (or most of) the time. The nearly constant itch can make it difficult to focus on everyday tasks, such as driving or getting your work done. The itch can make it difficult to fall asleep and can wake you from a sound sleep. Dry, cracked or raw skin often feels painful. When something touches the already painful skin, such as water, some people say their skin burns. In a cold, dry climate, this can happen to hairdressers and others who often have wet hands while at work. When skin loses a lot of moisture, it wrinkles and develops a rough texture. With age, it also becomes loose, as shown here. Excessively dry skin has breaks in its outer layer. This allows germs to get inside, which can lead to a skin infection. Signs of an infection are:The outer layer of our skin continually renews itself. As it does so, the body sheds dead skin cells. You usually donâ€™t see this shedding. When the skin sheds more than the usual number of skin cells, such as when the skin becomes excessively dry, iskin can peel off.When skin becomes excessively dry, it can feel raw from the cracking and bleeding. This womanâ€™s hands have nicks and cuts that bleed. What causes people to develop excessively dry skin varies. Some people get it from immersing their hands in water frequently throughout the day.  Hairstylists frequently develop excessively dry skin due to having frequently wet hands and using hair dyes and other beauty products. All of these can strip the much-needed oils from their hands. For others, excessively dry skin can be a sign of something else going on inside the body. Youâ€™ll find information about the many causes at: Dry skin: CausesImages

Symptoms include:
Painless tiny bumps on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks
Dry, rough skin in the areas with bumps
Worsening when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin
Sandpaper-like bumps resembling goose flesh
Treatment for keratosis pilaris usually isn't needed. But if you're concerned about your or your child's skin, consult your health care provider or a specialist in skin conditions (dermatologist).Keratosis pilaris is caused by the buildup of keratin â€” a hard protein that protects skin from harmful substances and infection. The keratin blocks the opening of hair follicles, causing patches of rough, bumpy skin.It's not clear why keratin builds up in people with keratosis pilaris. It might happen along with a genetic disease or skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. Dry skin tends to make keratosis pilaris worse.

Help your baby by following dermatologistsâ€™ tips to prevent and treat diaper rash at home:Change dirty diapers as soon as possible. The most important tip for treating and preventing diaper rash is to change all dirty diapers â€“ even if they are just wet â€“ as soon as possible. This reduces moisture on the skin that can inflame a rash.Be gentle when cleaning the diaper area. Use water and a soft washcloth or baby wipes that are alcohol and fragrance-free. If the rash is severe, use a squirt bottle of water to clean the area, as doing so is gentler to the skin. Next, allow the area to air dry. Let your child go diaper-free as long as possible to let the skin dry and heal.Apply a zinc oxide diaper cream. This is especially important if the skin stays red between diaper changes. If your baby has severe diaper rash, layer it on like you are frosting a cake. There is no need to remove the cream with each diaper change. It can be fully removed at the end of the day.Call a doctor or board-certified dermatologist if your baby develops signs of a skin infection. Signs of a skin infection may include a fever, blisters, pus that drains from the rash, and a rash that does not go away after treatment or worsens. Another sign of a skin infection is if the baby is in pain or is hard to console.Babies have very delicate skin, and sometimes despite a parentâ€™s best effort, diaper rash still occurs. If your babyâ€™s diaper rash is not going away, or if you have questions or concerns about caring for your babyâ€™s skin, consult a board-certified dermatologist.",,

Youâ€™ll often see small, firm bumps on the skin. These bumps can appear anywhere on the skin; however, children usually get them on their:TorsoArmpitsKnees (especially the backs of)Arms (especially in the crooks)Groin areaMollusca (the bumps) rarely appear on the palms or the soles, but you can get them in the moist tissue that lines the inside of your eyelids.The following pictures show you what molluscum contagiosum tends to look like. This lineup begins by showing you what the bumps look like when they first appear and ends with what you may see right before the skin clears.  The bumps appear on the skin between 2 and 8 weeks after you get the virus that causes this skin infection.When the bumps first appear, you usually see ones that are small, firm, pink, flesh-colored, or white. These bumps will likely get bigger.As the bumps grow, they become dome-shaped and develop an indent in the center, which can look like someone pushed a pin into the middle.When a bump develops on an eyelid, it often looks like a water blister, as shown here.Having molluscum on an eyelid can cause frequent pink eye. When the molluscum contagiosum clears, the pink eye also tends to disappear. Scratching or picking at one or more bumps and then touching skin without the molluscum contagiosum can spread the virus to other areas of your skin.In time, new bumps appear. Some people have widespread bumps, as shown here.Having a weakened immune system, due to an organ transplant, cancer treatment, or an HIV infection, can cause large bumps.Clusters of large bumps, such as shown here on this manâ€™s forehead, can appear.When the bumps become red and look like pimples, it means your body is fighting off the virus.This change is a good sign. It means the bumps will soon clear. This skin infection is usually only painful when scratching or rubbing infects the bumps with bacteria. Sometimes, the bumps feel itchy. The body can clear the bumps on its own, but this can take time. You may see new bumps for several months. As some bumps clear, new ones can appear. This cycle usually lasts about 6 to 18 months before the skin clears completely. Sometimes, clearing takes longer. New bumps can continue to appear for 3 or 4 years, and there have been reports of molluscum contagiosum lasting 5 years.Thereâ€™s no way to know how long it will take for your bumps to clear. Treatment can help clear the bumps more quickly.

A thick, rough area of skin
A hardened, raised bump
Tenderness or pain under the skin
Flaky, dry or waxy skin
Corns and calluses are not the same thing.
Corns are smaller and deeper than calluses and have a hard center surrounded by swollen skin. They can be painful when pressed. Hard corns often form on the top of the toes or the outer edge of the small toe. Soft corns tend to form between the toes.
Calluses are rarely painful and tend to develop on pressure spots, such as the heels, the balls of the feet, the palms and the knees. They may vary in size and shape and are often larger than corns.
If a corn or callus becomes very painful or inflamed, see your health care provider. If you have diabetes or poor blood flow, seek medical care before self-treating a corn or callus. This is important because even a minor injury to your foot can lead to an infected open sore (ulcer).Corns and calluses are caused by friction and pressure from repeated actions. Some sources of this friction and pressure include:
Wearing ill-fitting shoes and socks. Tight shoes and high heels can squeeze areas of the feet. If your shoes are loose, your foot may repeatedly slide and rub against the shoe. Your foot may also rub against a seam or stitch inside the shoe. Socks that don't fit right can also be a problem. 
Skipping socks. Wearing shoes and sandals without socks can cause friction on your feet.
Playing instruments or using hand tools. Calluses on the hands may result from the repeated pressure of activities such as playing instruments and using hand tools or even a pen.
Inheriting a tendency to develop corns. The type of corn that forms on non-weight-bearing areas, such as the soles and palms (keratosis punctata), might be caused by genetics.
If you have diabetes or another condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet, you're at greater risk of complications from corns and calluses.These approaches may help you prevent corns and calluses:
Wear shoes that give your toes plenty of room. If you can't wiggle your toes, your shoes are too tight. Have a shoe shop stretch your shoes at any point that rubs or pinches. Shop for shoes when your feet are most swollen, usually at the end of the day. If you use orthotics and inserts, be sure to have them on while fitting your shoes at the store.
Use protective coverings. Wear felt pads, nonmedicated corn pads or bandages over areas that rub against your footwear. You can also try toe separators or some lamb's wool between your toes.
Wear padded gloves when using hand tools. Or try padding your tool handles with cloth tape or covers.

The following pictures of atopic dermatitis show what you may see.While atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere, babies and young children often develop it on their cheeks, forehead, or scalp. Flare-ups can later also appear on the trunk, legs, or arms. On lighter skin tones, you often see a red rash with bumps (A). Children with darker skin tones may have several bumps with or without redness and darker areas of skin, like on this boyâ€™s forehead (B).Atopic dermatitis is intensely itchy. When babies have itchy skin, they rub against something. The rubbing can cause bumps, which can ooze and then crust over.You may see dry, scaly skin on any area of your babyâ€™s body. If your baby often rubs up against objects to relieve the itch of the dry, scaly skin, your baby may develop raw skin.The discomfort caused by the itch, rash, and dry skin can cause your baby to act fussy or have trouble sleeping. Lack of sleep is common in anyone who has atopic dermatitis, including babies and young children.As children grow and develop, atopic dermatitis often changes. Hereâ€™s what you may see.Between 2 years of age and puberty, the condition often affects these areas of the body. Children with lighter skin tones often develop an itchy rash in the creases of their elbows or backs of their knees. If your child has a darker skin tone, patches tend to form on the fronts of the knees, elbows, and backs of their hands. Other common places for atopic dermatitis to appear are the neck, wrists, and ankles. Children with brown or black skin are more likely than white children to have atopic dermatitis on their trunk.These creases, which are called Dennie-Morgan folds, also develop in people who have asthma or hay fever.Older children and teenagers may have small, itchy bumps on their skin instead of a weepy rash. Scratching can cause the spots to leak fluid and then crust over. On darker skin tones, the bumps tend to be gray to violet-brown in color.Skin that is constantly rubbed or scratched can thicken. This helps protect the skin. Thickened skin is often excessively dry and itches most of the time.Atopic dermatitis usually begins early in life and may go away during childhood or the teen years. Some people continue to have this condition as adults. Itâ€™s also possible for atopic dermatitis to begin when youâ€™re an adult.In adults, atopic dermatitis can take many forms. For some people, the condition looks the same as when they were a child or teenager. Adults may also develop the following:Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis on their hands. In fact, the hands may be the only place adults have the condition.Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis around their eyes. Youâ€™ll often see thickened skin thatâ€™s darker than the surrounding skin.If youâ€™ve had  atopic dermatitis for years, patches of your skin may have permanently thickened and developed a leathery texture, as shown here. This is caused by years of scratching. The affected skin also tends to look darker (or lighter) than the surrounding skin. The thickened skin can itch all the time, even when you donâ€™t have a flare-up.Discolored, extremely dry, and itchy skin: Adults may develop discolored skin thatâ€™s extremely dry and easily irritated. This often develops on the hands or feet, but it can occur anywhere. Some adults have nipple eczema, which can be itchy and painful. The dry, cracked skin and scratching make the skin more susceptible to infection. Infections that people with  atopic dermatitis can develop include: Yellow or golden crusts on the skin, like the ones above this childâ€™s lip, often indicate a staph infection. If you see golden or yellowish crusts, contact your dermatologistâ€™s office.Molluscum contagiosum: Having atopic dermatitis increases the risk of getting this common viral infection, which causes small bumps on the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, dermatologists often recommend treating molluscum, especially if it triggers a flare-up of atopic dermatitis.Eczema herpeticum: This is a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms include dome-shaped blisters and bumps, along with fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In children, babies, and anyone who is immunocompromised, eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care.Many studies find that having atopic dermatitis can cause people to feel anxious, depressed, or both. This is often due to the itch, pain, and problems sleeping. These feelings can also be triggered by flare-ups. Some people say they feel ashamed when others see flare-ups on their skin.When people feel anxious or depressed, they often spend more time alone. This can cause people to feel isolated.While studying atopic dermatitis, researchers have also discovered that some people are more likely than others to develop it.

If signs (what you see) or symptoms (what you feel) occur, a person may experience:Tingling, itching, or burning. Before the blisters appear, the skin may tingle, itch, or burn for a day or so.Sores. One or more painful, fluid-filled blisters may appear. Blisters break open and often ooze fluid and form a crust, before healing. The first time sores appear, they will show up between 2 and 20 days after a person has contact with an infected person. The sores can last from 7 to 10 days. Where the sores appear often varies with type:

Oral herpes (HSV-1): Most blisters appear on the lips or around the mouth. Sometimes blisters form on the face or on the tongue. Although these are the most common places to find oral herpes, the sores can appear anywhere on the skin.If a person has HSV-1, a bad sunburn can trigger a herpes simplex outbreak. Flu-like symptoms. Fever, muscle aches, or swollen lymph nodes (glands) in the neck (oral herpes) or groin (genital herpes) are possible.Problems urinating. People (most often women) with genital herpes may have trouble urinating or have a burning feeling while urinating.An eye infection (herpes keratitis). Sometimes the herpes simplex virus can spread to one or both eyes. If this happens, you can have pain, light sensitivity, discharge, and a gritty feeling in the eye. Without prompt treatment, scarring of the eye may result. Scarring can lead to cloudy vision and even loss of vision.If you develop signs and symptoms of herpes simplex, you can expect to have these for as long as listed below:Oral (mouth) herpes: two to three weeksGenital herpes: two to six weeks (the first outbreak)Herpes simplex outbreaks usually develop around the mouth or on the genitals, but the sores can appear almost anywhere on the skin.

If you do, your signs and symptoms will depend on whether you:Just caught the virus (newly infected)Have had the virus for some timeThe following explains what signs and symptoms develop, and when.Most people catch the virus when they are a child. Not every child who catches the virus, however, has symptoms. If symptoms occur, the child usually feels sick and has one or more of the following:A burning sensation in the mouth, followed by painful mouth sores, which can form on the tongue, gums, lips, or throatSore throatPain when swallowingSwollen lymph nodes (glands)FeverAches and painsHeadacheNauseaThese symptoms last from one to two weeks.Itâ€™s rare for adults to catch this virus. Itâ€™s so common and spreads so easily that most people get it in childhood.If you catch the virus as an adult, you may or may not have signs and symptoms. If you do, youâ€™ll have the same signs and symptoms as newly infected children. Adults often say they feel like they have the flu and have painful sores inside their mouth.When you first catch the virus that causes cold sores, sores appear inside your mouth.After you get infected, the virus travels to your nerves and stay there until it reawakens. Even if you never have symptoms, the virus will still travel to your nerves. Because there is currently no cure, the virus lives inside your body permanently.Even with the virus inside your body, you may never get a cold sore. Some people, however, get cold sores from time to time.If you get cold sores from time to time, the outbreak tends to be less severe than when you were newly infected. The signs and symptoms also differ.If you get cold sores, youâ€™ll usually have the following signs and symptoms:Warnings symptoms begin. A day or two before you get a cold sore, you may feel one or more of the following on your skin where a cold sore will appear.

BurningSome people who have these warning symptoms never get cold sores.Medicine, which you can buy without a prescription, can shorten how long you have cold sores. You need to apply it at the first sign of a cold sore.Cold sores appear. One or more painful, fluid-filled blisters appear. These usually form on your lips or around your mouth. They can also appear elsewhere on your face.

If you have a sore near an eye, you should see an eye doctor immediately. The virus can spread to the eyes. Warning signs that this has happened include your eyes becoming sensitive to light or feeling painful. Your eyes may also feel gritty or runny.

If any of these symptoms develop, you need immediate medical treatment. Without treatment, your eyesight could be affected.

Sometimes, blisters appear elsewhere. They can appear on a hand or in the genital area. This can happen when you spread the virus from your mouth to other areas by touching a cold sore and then touching another part of your body.

You can avoid spreading the virus to other parts of your body by not touching another part of your body after touching a cold sore. Washing your hands after touching a cold sore can also help prevent spreading the virus to other parts of your body.

You can avoid spreading the virus to other parts of your body by always washing your hands after touching your cold sores.Sores crust over. Within 48 hours of the warning symptoms, cold sores usually break open. They will ooze fluid and then crust over (form scabs).

In healthy people, most cold sores disappear within 5 to 15 days. They often heal without leaving a scar.If you have cold sores for longer than 15 days, you should see your primary care doctor or dermatologist. Some people need treatment to get rid of cold sores.Images

This lineup begins by showing you what the bumps look like when they first appear and ends with what you may see right before the skin clears.  The bumps appear on the skin between 2 and 8 weeks after you get the virus that causes this skin infection.When the bumps first appear, you usually see ones that are small, firm, pink, flesh-colored, or white. These bumps will likely get bigger.As the bumps grow, they become dome-shaped and develop an indent in the center, which can look like someone pushed a pin into the middle.When a bump develops on an eyelid, it often looks like a water blister, as shown here.Having molluscum on an eyelid can cause frequent pink eye. When the molluscum contagiosum clears, the pink eye also tends to disappear. Scratching or picking at one or more bumps and then touching skin without the molluscum contagiosum can spread the virus to other areas of your skin.In time, new bumps appear. Some people have widespread bumps, as shown here.Having a weakened immune system, due to an organ transplant, cancer treatment, or an HIV infection, can cause large bumps.Clusters of large bumps, such as shown here on this manâ€™s forehead, can appear.When the bumps become red and look like pimples, it means your body is fighting off the virus.This change is a good sign. It means the bumps will soon clear. This skin infection is usually only painful when scratching or rubbing infects the bumps with bacteria. Sometimes, the bumps feel itchy. The body can clear the bumps on its own, but this can take time. You may see new bumps for several months. As some bumps clear, new ones can appear. This cycle usually lasts about 6 to 18 months before the skin clears completely. Sometimes, clearing takes longer. New bumps can continue to appear for 3 or 4 years, and there have been reports of molluscum contagiosum lasting 5 years.Thereâ€™s no way to know how long it will take for your bumps to clear. Treatment can help clear the bumps more quickly.

A small, rough growth on the bottom of your foot, usually at the base of the toes or on the ball or heel
On brown and Black skin, the growth may be lighter than unaffected skin
Hard, thickened skin (callus) over a spot on the skin, where a wart has grown inward
Black pinpoints, which are small clotted blood vessels commonly called wart seeds
A cluster of growths on the sole of the foot (mosaic warts)
A growth that interrupts the normal lines and ridges in the skin of your foot
Pain or tenderness when walking or standing
See your health care provider for the growth on your foot if:
The growth is bleeding, painful or changes in shape or color
You've tried treating the wart, but it persists, multiplies or comes back after clearing for a time (recurs)
Your pain interferes with your activities
You also have diabetes or poor feeling in your feet
You also have a weak immune system because of immune-suppressing drugs, HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders
You aren't sure if the growth is a wart
Plantar warts are caused by an infection with HPV in the outer layer of skin on the soles of the feet. The warts develop when the virus enters through tiny cuts, breaks or weak spots on the bottom of the foot. If left untreated, warts can last from a few months to 2 years in children, and several years in in adults.HPV is very common, and more than 100 kinds of the virus exist. But only a few of them cause warts on the feet. Other types of HPV are more likely to cause warts on other areas of your skin or on mucous membranes.Each person's immune system responds differently to HPV. Not everyone who comes in contact with it develops warts. Even people in the same family react to the virus differently.The HPV strains that cause plantar warts aren't highly contagious. So the virus isn't easily spread by direct contact from one person to another. But it thrives in warm, moist places, so you might get the virus by walking barefoot around swimming pools or locker rooms. If the virus spreads from the first site of infection, more warts may grow.Anyone can develop plantar warts, but this type of wart is more likely to affect:
Children and teenagers
People with weak immune systems
People who have had plantar warts before
People who walk barefoot in areas where a wart-causing virus is common, such as locker rooms and swimming pools
When plantar warts cause pain, you may alter your normal posture or gait â€” perhaps without realizing it. Eventually, this change in how you stand, walk or run can cause muscle or joint discomfort.To help prevent plantar warts:
Avoid direct contact with warts. This includes your own warts. Wash your hands carefully after touching a wart.
Keep your feet clean and dry.
Wear sandals or other foot protection when walking around swimming pools, in locker rooms or in gym showers.
Don't pick at or scratch warts.
When using an emery board, pumice stone or nail clipper on your warts, choose one that you don't use on your healthy skin and nails.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a type of skin cancer that can show up on the skin in many ways. Sometimes, it can be mistaken for a harmless pimple, scar, or sore. Most basal cell carcinoma's grow slowly.This skin cancer often develops on the head or neck and looks like a shiny, raised, and round growth.To help you spot basal cell carcinoma before it grows deep into your skin, dermatologists share these 7 warning signs that could be easily missed. If you find any of the following signs on your skin, see a board-certified dermatologist. Board-certified dermatologists know how to tell the difference between something small and something major. Warning sign: A pink or reddish growth that dips in the center
Can be mistaken for: A skin injury or acne scarThe basal cell carcinoma on this patientâ€™s cheek could be mistaken for a minor skin injury.Warning sign: A growth or scaly area of skin on or near the ear
Can be mistaken for: Scaly and dry skin, a minor injury, or a scarBasal cell carcinoma often develops on or near an ear. Both the basal cell carcinoma next to a Black woman's ear and the one (circled in purple) next to a white man's ear could be mistaken for a minor skin injury.Warning sign: A sore that doesn't heal (or heals and returns) and may bleed, ooze, or crust over
Can be mistaken for: A sore or pimpleThis patient mistook the basal cell carcinoma on his nose for a non-healing pimple.Warning sign: A scaly, slightly raised patch of irritated skin, which could be red, pink, or another color
Can be mistaken for: Dry, irritated skin, especially if it's red or pinkThis basal cell carcinoma could be mistaken for an area of dry, irritated skin.Warning sign: A round growth that may be pink, red, brown, black, tan, or the same color as your skin
Can be mistaken for: A mole, wart, or other harmless growthWould you recognize this as a skin cancer, or would you dismiss it as a harmless growth on your face?Warning sign: A spot on the skin that feels a bit scaly
Could be mistaken for: Age spot or freckleThis basal cell carcinoma could easily be mistaken for an age spot, which is why itâ€™s so important to have a dermatologist examine your skin before you treat an age spot.Warning sign: A scar-like mark on your skin that may be white, yellow, or skin-colored and waxy. The affected skin may look shiny, and the surrounding skin often feels tight.
Could be mistaken for: A scarAppearing on an elderly womanâ€™s skin, this basal cell carcinoma could easily have been mistaken for a scar.While the above pictures show you some common ways that basal cell carcinoma can appear on the skin, this skin cancer can show up in other ways, as the following pictures illustrate.On the trunk, basal cell carcinoma may look like a scaly patch with a spot of normal-looking skin in the center and a slightly raised border, as shown here.While basal cell carcinoma tends to be one color, it can be lighter in some areas and darker in others, as shown here.Most basal cell carcinoma are red or pink; however, this skin cancer can be brown, black, blue, gray, the same color as your skin, white, or yellowish.Basal cell carcinoma can look like a group of small, shiny bumps that feel smooth to the touch.The basal cell carcinoma on this patientâ€™s lower eyelid looks like a wart (spot just below the eyelid marked with an â•) in one area and a sore (area on the eyelid marked with two â•â•) in another area.This skin cancer tends to be one color, but the color can vary from one basal cell carcinoma to the next. This cancer may be:Red or pink (most common)Brown, black, blue, gray, or show flecks of these colorsThe same color as your skin YellowishWhiteFor many people, the only sign of this skin cancer is a slow-growing bump, sore-like growth, or rough-feeling area on their skin. However, some people develop symptoms where they have this skin cancer.Symptoms include:NumbnessA pins-and-needles sensationExtreme sensitivityItchingMany people find it when they notice a spot, lump, or scaly area on their skin that is growing or feels different from the rest of their skin. If you notice any spot on your skin that is growing, bleeding, or changing in any way, see a board-certified dermatologist. These doctors have the most training and experience in diagnosing skin cancer.To find skin cancer early, dermatologists recommend that everyone check their own skin with a skin self-exam. This is especially important for people who have a higher risk of developing basal cell carcinoma.Youâ€™ll find out what can increase your risk of getting this skin cancer at, Basal cell carcinoma: Who gets and causes.ImagesÂ (in order of appearance) used with permission of:The American Academy of Dermatology National Library of Dermatologic Teaching Slides.J Am Acad Dermatol. 2019;80:303-17.J Am Acad Dermatol 2006;55:741-60.J Am Acad Dermatol. 2006;55:741-60.DermNet NZJ Am Acad Dermatol. 2006;55:741-60.JAAD Case Rep. 2018; Jun 23;4(6):599-601.J Am Acad Dermatol. 2019;80:303-17.JAAD Case Rep. 2018; Jun 23;4(6):599-601.The American Academy of Dermatology National Library of Dermatologic Teaching Slides.J Am Acad Dermatol 2006;55:741-60.J Am Acad Dermatol. 2019;80:303-17.The American Academy of Dermatology National Library of Dermatologic Teaching Slides.The American Academy of Dermatology National Library of Dermatologic Teaching Slides.J Am Acad Dermatol. 2019;80:303-17.DermNet NZReferences

0,Actinic Keratosis Basal Cell Carcinoma and other Malignant Lesions,Squamous Cell Carcinoma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352480,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352480,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin most often occurs on sun-exposed skin. This includes the scalp, the backs of the hands, the ears or the lips. But it can occur anywhere on the body. It can even occur inside the mouth, on the bottoms of the feet or on the genitals. When squamous cell carcinoma of the skin happens in people with Black and brown skin, it tends to happen in places that aren't exposed to the sun.Symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include:
A firm bump on the skin, called a nodule. The nodule might be the same color as the skin, or it might look different. It can look pink, red, black or brown, depending on skin color.
A flat sore with a scaly crust.
A new sore or raised area on an old scar or sore.
A rough, scaly patch on the lip that may become an open sore.
A sore or rough patch inside the mouth.
A raised patch or wartlike sore on or in the anus or on the genitals.
Make an appointment with a health care professional for a sore or scab that doesn't heal in about two months or a flat patch of scaly skin that won't go away.Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin occurs when the squamous cells in the skin get changes in their DNA. Cells' DNA holds the instructions that tell cells what to do. The changes tell the squamous cells to multiply quickly. The cells continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle.This causes too many cells. The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body.Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes most of the DNA changes in skin cells. UV radiation can come from sunlight, tanning lamps and tanning beds.But skin cancers also can grow on skin that's not usually in sunlight. This means that other factors might add to the risk of skin cancer. One such factor might be having a condition that weakens the immune system.Factors that can increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include:

Having skin that sunburns easily. Anyone of any skin color can get squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. But it's more common in people who have low levels of melanin in their skin. Melanin is a substance that gives color to skin. It also helps protect the skin from damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation. People with Black or brown skin have more melanin than people with white skin.
The risk of squamous cell carcinoma is highest in people who have blond or red hair, have light-colored eyes and freckle or sunburn easily.

Being in the sun too much. UV radiation from the sun increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Covering the skin with clothes or sunblock can help lower the risk.
Using tanning beds. People who use indoor tanning beds have an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
Having a history of sunburns. Having had one or more sunburns that raised blisters as a child or teenager increases the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the skin as an adult. Sunburns in adulthood also are a risk factor.
Having a history of precancerous skin lesions. Some types of skin sores can turn into skin cancer. Examples are actinic keratosis or Bowen disease.  Having one of these conditions increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.
Having a history of skin cancer. People who've had squamous cell carcinoma of the skin once are much more likely to get it again.
Having a weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of skin cancer. This includes people who have leukemia or lymphoma. And it includes those who take medicines to control the immune system, such as those who have had organ transplants.
Having a rare genetic disorder. People with xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes great sensitivity to sunlight, have a greatly increased risk of developing skin cancer.
Having human papillomavirus infection (HPV). This common infection that's passed through sexual contact increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
Having scars or long-lasting wounds on the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can form in scars, burns and sores that don't heal.
Untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can destroy nearby healthy tissue. It can spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. And it can be fatal, although this is not common.The risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin spreading may be higher if the cancer:
Grows very large or deep.
Involves the mucous membranes, such as the lips.
Occurs in a person with a weakened immune system. Examples of things that might cause a weakened immune system include having chronic leukemia or taking medicine to control the immune system after an organ transplant.
Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin can be prevented. To protect yourself:
Stay out of the sun during the middle of the day. For much of North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Plan outdoor activities at other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy. When outside, stay in shade as much as possible.
Wear sunscreen year-round. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously. Apply again every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating.
Wear protective clothing. Wear dark, tightly woven clothes that cover arms and legs. Wear a wide-brimmed hat that shades your face and ears. Don't forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV radiation, UVA and UVB rays.
Don't use tanning beds. The lights in tanning beds give off UV radiation. Using tanning beds increases the risk of skin cancer.

Check your skin often and report changes to your health care team. Look at your skin often for new growths. Look for changes in moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. Use mirrors to check your face, neck, ears and scalp.
Look at your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Look at the front and back of your legs and your feet. Look at the bottom of the feet and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.

People can mistake it for a:Insect biteSoreCystStyePimpleThis skin cancer often develops on the head or neck and can look like a sore.Because MCC is so aggressive, finding it early can be life-saving. Key facts about this skin cancer that can help you find it early are that MCC tends to:Grow quickly: It usually becomes noticeably bigger in a few weeks to months. Be pink, red, or purple Feel painlessDevelop on the head or neck: While it can develop anywhere on the skin, it usually appears on skin thatâ€™s gotten lots of sun over the years, such as the head or neck.Appear after 50 years of age: Research shows that 97% of people who develop this rare skin cancer are older than 501. Most people are in their 70s or 80s when diagnosed with MCC2. While MCC tends to develop in older, fair-skinned people, young adults and those who have skin of color can get this skin cancer. Even a few children have had MCC.In African Americans, MCC tends to develop on a leg. Younger people tend to get it on their torsos.To help you spot MCC, the following pictures show you diverse ways that it can appear on the skin.Looking much like an insect bite, testing revealed that the reddish spot on this patientâ€™s shin was actually Merkel cell carcinoma.The reddish, scaly, and slightly raised spot on this patientâ€™s wrist is Merkel cell carcinoma, which could easily have been mistaken for a sore.Any spot on your skin that is growing, bleeding, or changing in any way could be a skin cancer.This 87-year-old man was concerned about this quickly growing, dome-shaped mass on this lower eyelid, which testing showed was a Merkel cell carcinoma.This aggressive skin cancer can look like a rapidly growing stye or cyst. Unlike a stye or cyst, Merkel cell carcinoma often feels painless.Sometimes, this aggressive skin cancer looks like a sore, so itâ€™s important to see a dermatologist if you notice a new spot on your skin that is growing rapidly. Skin cancer can also look like a sore that heals and returns.While Merkel cell carcinoma often looks like a dome-shaped growth or slightly raised and scaly patch, it can appear on the skin in diverse ways, as did the Merkel cell carcinoma on this manâ€™s head.While Merkel cell carcinoma usually develops on the head or neck, it can appear anywhere on the skin.While MCC is often painless, it can feel sore and tender. Some people say the growth itches.Many people who develop MCC are otherwise healthy. If you have certain risk factors, you have a greater risk of getting this skin cancer.Youâ€™ll find out what increases the risk of developing MCC at, Merkel cell carcinoma: Causes.1 Haley CT, Mui UN, et al. â€œHuman Oncoviruses: Mucocutaneous Manifestations, Pathogenesis, Therapeutics, and Prevention (Part I: Papillomaviruses and Merkel cell polyomavirus).â€ J Am Acad Dermatol.  doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2018.09.062.

Signs like a rash or light spots on your skin tend to develop before symptoms.Studies show that more than half the people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma develop itchy skin. Itchy skin tends to be more common if you have a:More advanced stage of cutaneous T-cell lymphomaType of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma called SÃ©zary (Sez-zah-ree) syndromeThe itch can be intense. As the cancer worsens, the itch can make it hard to sleep.Other symptoms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma include fever, chills, weight loss, and feeling tired. Not everyone develops these symptoms.There are several types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also known as CTCL. What you see on your skin (signs) tends to vary with the:Type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma you haveStage of the cancerThe following cutaneous T-cell lymphoma pictures show you how these cancers can show up on the skin. Many of these pictures show the most common type, which is mycosis fungoides (my-co-sis fuhng-goi-des).When it begins, mycosis fungoides often looks like a rash or sunburn. This rash usually appears on skin that gets little sun like the upper thigh, buttocks, belly, or groin. The rash can last for months or years. On lighter skin tones, the area often looks red or pink. People with darker skin tones tend to see a brown or purple rash.If mycosis fungoides progresses, the rash can turn into flat, scaly, reddish patches (A). These patches may be mistaken for another skin disease like eczema or psoriasis. Instead of having scaly patches, some people see light spots (B). Light spots are more common in people who have darker skin tones, children, and teenagers.If the cancer progresses, the flat patches turn into plaques, which are raised patches. The plaques are often itchy. In darker skin tones, plaques tend to be dark brown, grayish, or purple. People who have lighter skin tones tend to have red or pink plaques.Tumors are a sign of advanced cancer. You can develop tumors where you have plaques on your skin or on skin without signs of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Some patients have patches, plaques, and tumors (A). In darker skin tones (B), the tumors may be reddish in color to purple.People who have darker skin tones may develop scaly, raised patches that are darker than their natural skin tone and lose skin color in other areas, as shown here.An advanced cancer, SÃ©zary syndrome can cause peeling skin, a rash over most of the body, and tumors on the skin. The skin can feel hot, sore, or intensely itchy. People with lighter skin tones often develop a red rash. On darker skin tones, the rash may be less noticeable.Different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can cause hair loss, which may occur anywhere on the body. This patient developed hair loss where a light patch developed on his chin. Hair often regrows after the cancer is treated.The different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can also cause:A skin infection: Signs of a skin infection include widespread skin discoloration, hot spots on your skin, painful burning, swollen skin, pus draining from a wound, or an oozing sore. If you see any of these on your skin, get medical care. A skin infection can be serious in people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.Thickening of the skin on the palms and soles: This skin in these areas can also split, causing deep, painful cracks in the skin.Slack skin: Developing slowly, this eventually causes noticeable loose, hanging skin that doesnâ€™t spring back. Slack skin usually appears in the armpit or groin.Swollen lymph nodes: This doesnâ€™t always mean that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Only in the most advanced stage are cancer cells found in the lymph nodes.Nail changes: These changes include developing a nail infection, ridges in the nails, rough-feeling nails, yellow nails, and nails that separate from the nail bed. Most nail changes occur in people who have SÃ©zary syndrome.Eyelid changes: The lower eyelid can droop and turn outward, which can feel uncomfortable.Lion-like look to the face: If plaques and tumors develop on the face, these can      change facial features, giving people a lion-like look. This is very rare.Why some people develop this type of cancer is still a bit of a mystery. While doing research to answer this question, researchers discovered that some people are more likely to develop it than others.

This uncontrolled growth takes place in your bone marrow, where most of your bodyâ€™s blood is made. Leukemia cells are usually immature (still developing) white blood cells.

It isn't usually painful and may go unnoticed for a while.Leukoplakia may appear:
White or grayish in patches that can't be wiped away
Irregular or flat-textured
Thickened or hardened in areas
Along with raised, red lesions (speckled leukoplakia or erythroplakia), which are more likely to show precancerous changes
Hairy leukoplakia causes fuzzy, white patches that resemble folds or ridges, usually on the sides of your tongue. It's often mistaken for oral thrush, an infection marked by creamy white patches that can be wiped away, which is also common in people with a weakened immune system.Even though leukoplakia doesn't usually cause discomfort, sometimes it can indicate a more serious condition.See your dentist or primary care professional if you have any of the following:
White plaques or sores in your mouth that don't heal on their own within two weeks
    
Lumps or white, red or dark patches in your mouth
    
Persistent changes in the tissues of your mouth
    
Ear pain when swallowing
    
Progressive reduction in the ability to open your jaw
    
Although the cause of leukoplakia is unknown, chronic irritation, such as from tobacco use, including smoking and chewing, appears to be responsible for most cases. Often, regular users of smokeless tobacco products eventually develop leukoplakia where they hold the tobacco against their cheeks.Other causes may include chronic irritation from:
Jagged, broken or sharp teeth rubbing on tongue surfaces
Broken or ill-fitting dentures
Long-term alcohol use
Your dentist can talk with you about what may be causing leukoplakia in your case.Hairy leukoplakia results from infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Once you've been infected with EBV, the virus remains in your body for life. Normally, the virus is dormant, but if your immune system is weakened, especially from HIV/AIDS, the virus can become reactivated, leading to conditions such as hairy leukoplakia.Tobacco use, particularly smokeless tobacco, puts you at high risk of leukoplakia and oral cancer. Long-term alcohol use increases your risk, and drinking alcohol combined with smoking increases your risk even more.People with HIV/AIDS are especially likely to develop hairy leukoplakia. Although the use of antiretroviral drugs has reduced the number of cases, hairy leukoplakia still affects a number of HIV-positive people, and it may be one of the first signs of HIV infection.Leukoplakia usually doesn't cause permanent damage to tissues in your mouth. However, leukoplakia increases your risk of oral cancer. Oral cancers often form near leukoplakia patches, and the patches themselves may show cancerous changes. Even after leukoplakia patches are removed, the risk of oral cancer remains.Hairy leukoplakia isn't likely to lead to cancer. But it may indicate HIV/AIDS.You may be able to prevent leukoplakia if you avoid all tobacco products or alcohol use. Talk to your doctor about methods to help you quit. If you continue to smoke or chew tobacco or drink alcohol, have frequent dental checkups. Oral cancers are usually painless until fairly advanced, so quitting tobacco and alcohol is a better prevention strategy.If you have a weakened immune system, you may not be able to prevent hairy leukoplakia, but identifying it early can help you receive appropriate treatment.

How many of the ABCDEs can you find in the following pictures of melanoma?Would you mistake these melanomas for odd-shaped moles?Both show the A (asymmetrical shape) and B (border uneven) of melanoma. The melanoma on the right shows the C (color varies).Melanoma often contains shades of brown, black, or tan, but some can be red or pink, such as the one shown here.Still you can see some of the ABCDEs here.

Some break open and bleed.If this happens, make an appointment for your child to see a board-certified dermatologist.Where it usually develops on the body: Anywhere on the skin.Will it go away? Most fade on their own, but it takes time. About half disappear by 5 years of age. Nearly 90% will be gone by the time a child is 10 years old. As it fades, it can leave a light spot or scar on the skin.Medical name: Nevus simplexWhat it looks like: Youâ€™ll see a flat, pink, red, or salmon-colored spot or patch.


Angel's kiss on baby's face

Fever
Headache
Fatigue
Weight loss
General aches and pains
Other signs and symptoms are related to the parts of the body affected, including:
Digestive system. If your stomach or intestines are affected, you may experience pain after eating. Ulcers and perforations are possible and may result in blood in the stool.
Ears. Dizziness, ringing in the ears and abrupt hearing loss may occur.
Eyes. Vasculitis can make your eyes look red and itch or burn. Giant cell arteritis can cause double vision and temporary or permanent blindness in one or both eyes. This is sometimes the first sign of the disease.
Hands or feet. Some types of vasculitis can cause numbness or weakness in a hand or foot. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet might swell or harden.
Lungs. You may develop shortness of breath or even cough up blood if vasculitis affects your lungs.
Skin. Bleeding under the skin can show up as red spots. Vasculitis can also cause lumps or open sores on your skin.
Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. Some types of vasculitis can worsen quickly, so early diagnosis is the key to getting effective treatment.The exact cause of vasculitis isn't fully understood. Some types are related to a person's genetic makeup. Others result from the immune system attacking blood vessel cells by mistake. Possible triggers for this immune system reaction include:
Infections, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C
Blood cancers
Immune system diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and scleroderma
Reactions to certain drugs
Vasculitis can happen to anyone. Factors that may increase the risk of certain disorders include:
Age. Giant cell arteritis rarely occurs before the age of 50, while Kawasaki disease is most common in children younger than 5 years old.
Family history. Behcet's disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Kawasaki disease sometimes run in families.
Lifestyle choices. Using cocaine can increase your risk of developing vasculitis. Smoking tobacco, especially if you're a man younger than 45, can increase your risk of Buerger's disease.
Medications. Vasculitis can sometimes be triggered by medications such as hydralazine, allopurinol, minocycline and propylthiouracil.
Infections. Having hepatitis B or C can increase your risk of vasculitis.
Immune disorders. People who have disorders in which their immune systems mistakenly attack their own bodies may be at higher risk of vasculitis. Examples include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.
Sex. Giant cell arteritis is much more common in women, while Buerger's disease is more common in men.
Vasculitis complications depend on the type and severity of your condition. Or they may be related to side effects of the prescription medications you use to treat the condition. Complications of vasculitis include:
Organ damage. Some types of vasculitis can be severe, causing damage to major organs.
Blood clots and aneurysms. A blood clot may form in a blood vessel, obstructing blood flow. Rarely, vasculitis will cause a blood vessel to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um).
Vision loss or blindness. This is a possible complication of untreated giant cell arteritis.
Infections. Some of the medications used to treat vasculitis may weaken your immune system. This can make you more prone to infections.

The first warning signs usually involve your sinuses, throat or lungs. The condition often worsens rapidly, affecting blood vessels and the organs they supply, such as the kidneys.Signs and symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis might include:
Pus-like drainage with crusts from your nose, stuffiness, sinus infections and nosebleeds
Coughing, sometimes with bloody phlegm
Shortness of breath or wheezing
Fever
Fatigue
Joint pain
Numbness in your limbs, fingers or toes
Weight loss
Blood in your urine
Skin sores, bruising or rashes
Eye redness, burning or pain, and vision problems
Ear inflammation and hearing problems
For some people, the disease affects only the lungs. When the kidneys are affected, blood and urine tests can detect the problem. Without treatment, kidney or lung failure can occur.See your doctor if you have a runny nose that doesn't respond to over-the-counter cold medicines, especially if it's accompanied by nosebleeds and pus-like material, coughing up blood, or other warning signs of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Because this disease can worsen quickly, early diagnosis is key to getting effective treatment.The cause of granulomatosis with polyangiitis isn't known. It's not contagious, and there's no evidence that it's inherited.The condition can lead to inflamed, narrowed blood vessels and harmful inflammatory tissue masses (granulomas). Granulomas can destroy normal tissue, and narrowed blood vessels reduce the amount of blood and oxygen that reaches your body's tissues and organs.Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can occur at any age. It most often affects people between the ages of 40 and 65.Besides affecting your nose, sinuses, throat, lungs and kidneys, granulomatosis with polyangiitis can affect your skin, eyes, ears, heart and other organs. Complications might include:
Hearing loss
Skin scarring
Kidney damage
A loss of height in the bridge of the nose (saddling) caused by weakened cartilage
A blood clot forming in one or more deep veins, usually in your leg

Rash (purpura). Reddish-purple spots that look like bruises develop on the buttocks, legs and feet. The rash can also appear on the arms, face and trunk and may be worse in areas of pressure, such as the sock line and waistline.
Swollen, sore joints (arthritis). People with Henoch-Schonlein purpura often have pain and swelling around the joints â€” mainly in the knees and ankles. Joint pain sometimes precedes the classical rash by one or two weeks. These symptoms subside when the disease clears and leave no lasting damage.
Digestive tract symptoms. Many children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura develop belly pain, nausea, vomiting and bloody stools. These symptoms sometimes occur before the rash appears.
Kidney involvement. Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also affect the kidneys. In most cases, this shows up as protein or blood in the urine, which you may not even know is there unless you have a urine test done. Usually this goes away once the illness passes, but some people develop persistent kidney disease.

Within days, this bump can develop into a large, painful open sore.The ulcer usually appears on your legs, but may develop anywhere on your body. Sometimes it appears around surgical sites. If you have several ulcers, they may grow and merge into one larger ulcer.Talk to your doctor if you develop a painful, rapidly growing skin wound.The exact cause of pyoderma gangrenosum is unknown. The condition is not infectious or contagious. It's often associated with autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and arthritis. And it may have a genetic component.If you have pyoderma gangrenosum, new skin trauma, such as a cut or puncture wound, may trigger new ulcers.Certain factors may increase your risk of pyoderma gangrenosum, including:
Your age and sex. The condition can affect anyone at any age, though it's more common between 20 and 50 years of age.
Having inflammatory bowel disease. People with a digestive tract disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Having arthritis. People with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Having a blood disorder. People with acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplasia or a myeloproliferative disorder are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Possible complications of pyoderma gangrenosum include infection, scarring, uncontrolled pain, depression and loss of mobility.You can't totally prevent pyoderma gangrenosum. If you have the condition, try to avoid injuring your skin. Injury or trauma to your skin, including from surgery, can provoke new ulcers to form. It may also help to control any underlying condition that may be causing the ulcers.

Fever
Headache
Fatigue
Weight loss
General aches and pains
Other signs and symptoms are related to the parts of the body affected, including:
Digestive system. If your stomach or intestines are affected, you may experience pain after eating. Ulcers and perforations are possible and may result in blood in the stool.
Ears. Dizziness, ringing in the ears and abrupt hearing loss may occur.
Eyes. Vasculitis can make your eyes look red and itch or burn. Giant cell arteritis can cause double vision and temporary or permanent blindness in one or both eyes. This is sometimes the first sign of the disease.
Hands or feet. Some types of vasculitis can cause numbness or weakness in a hand or foot. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet might swell or harden.
Lungs. You may develop shortness of breath or even cough up blood if vasculitis affects your lungs.
Skin. Bleeding under the skin can show up as red spots. Vasculitis can also cause lumps or open sores on your skin.
Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. Some types of vasculitis can worsen quickly, so early diagnosis is the key to getting effective treatment.The exact cause of vasculitis isn't fully understood. Some types are related to a person's genetic makeup. Others result from the immune system attacking blood vessel cells by mistake. Possible triggers for this immune system reaction include:
Infections, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C
Blood cancers
Immune system diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and scleroderma
Reactions to certain drugs
Vasculitis can happen to anyone. Factors that may increase the risk of certain disorders include:
Age. Giant cell arteritis rarely occurs before the age of 50, while Kawasaki disease is most common in children younger than 5 years old.
Family history. Behcet's disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Kawasaki disease sometimes run in families.
Lifestyle choices. Using cocaine can increase your risk of developing vasculitis. Smoking tobacco, especially if you're a man younger than 45, can increase your risk of Buerger's disease.
Medications. Vasculitis can sometimes be triggered by medications such as hydralazine, allopurinol, minocycline and propylthiouracil.
Infections. Having hepatitis B or C can increase your risk of vasculitis.

Common reported triggers for these flares include sun exposure, emotional stress, cold or hot weather, alcohol, spicy foods, exercise, wind, cosmetics, and hot baths or hot drinks. These symptoms persist throughout other phases of the disorder. In the vascular phase, patients develop facial erythema and edema with multiple telangiectases, possibly as a result of persistent vasomotor instability.   An inflammatory phase often follows, in which sterile papules and pustules (leading to the designation of rosacea as adult acne) develop.   The late phase (developing in some patients), is characterized by coarse tissue hyperplasia of the cheeks and nose (rhinophyma) caused by tissue inflammation, collagen deposition, and sebaceous gland hyperplasia.   The phases of rosacea are usually sequential. Some patients go directly into the inflammatory stage, bypassing the earlier stages. Treatment may cause rosacea to return to an earlier stage. Progression to the late stage is not inevitable. Ocular rosacea often precedes or accompanies facial rosacea and manifests as some combination of blepharoconjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis, and keratitis, causing itching, foreign body sensation, erythema, and edema of the eye.

Typically, the blisters occur in a straight line in the area where the plant brushed along the skin. The rash may appear at different times in different locations because of repeat contact with contaminated clothing and other objects or because some parts of the skin are more sensitive than others.  The blister fluid itself is not contagious.  The itching and rash can take several weeks to go away after the last exposure.     ",,

Signs range from erythema, scaling, and edema to erosions, crusting, and blistering. Chronic and cumulative ICD is more often pruritic.       Allergic contact dermatitis    ACD is more pruritic than painful. Skin changes range from erythema, scaling, and edema, through vesiculation to severe swelling with bullae. Changes often occur in a pattern, distribution, or combination that suggests a specific exposure, such as linear streaking on an arm or leg (eg, due to brushing against poison ivy) or circumferential erythema (under a wristwatch or waistband). Linear streaks are almost always indicative of an external allergen or irritant.  The site of contact is where the allergen contacted the skin, very often the hands, because they touch so many substances. Although the palms and the palmar sides of the fingers are most exposed, ACD often starts in the web spaces between fingers because the thick stratum corneum prevents or delays allergen penetration on the palms and palmar sides of the fingers (also on the soles). With airborne exposure (eg, perfume aerosols), areas not covered by clothing are predominantly affected. Although ACD is typically limited to the site of contact, it may later spread because of scratching and autoeczematization (id reaction, a dermatitis at sites remote from the site of the initial inflammatory problem or infection). Because of the time needed to recruit and expand T cells in the epidermis, ACD typically takes â‰¥ 1 day after exposure to become noticeable and takes 2 to 3 days to become further aggravated (crescendo reaction). (In contrast, ICD typically decreases in intensity [decrescendo reaction] after 1 or 2 days.)        Pearls & Pitfalls     Lesion shape or pattern (linear streaks are almost always indicative of an external allergen or irritant) can help differentiate contact dermatitis from other forms of dermatitis.

Anabolic steroid use typically causes acne on the shoulders and upper back. There are three levels of acne severity:  Mild acne Moderate acne Severe acne Yet even mild acne can be distressing, especially to adolescents, who see each pimple as a major cosmetic challenge.        Comparing Mild Acne and Severe Acne                       People with mild acne develop only a few noninflamed blackheads or whiteheads, or a moderate number of small, mildly irritated pimples. Pustules, which resemble pimples with yellow tops, may also develop. Blackheads appear as small flesh-colored bumps with a dark center. Whiteheads have a similar appearance but lack the dark center. Pimples are mildly uncomfortable and have a white center surrounded by a small area of reddened skin. People with moderate acne have more blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, and pustules. People with severe acne have either very large numbers of blackheads and whiteheads, pimples, and pustules or cystic (deep) acne. In cystic acne, people have cysts that are large, red, painful, pus-filled nodules that may merge under the skin into larger, oozing abscesses. Mild acne usually does not leave scars. However, squeezing pimples or trying to open them in other ways increases inflammation and the depth of injury to the skin, making scarring more likely. The cysts and abscesses of severe acne often rupture and, after healing, typically leave scars. Scars may be tiny, deep holes (icepick scars); wider pits of varying depth; or large, irregular indentations. Acne scars last a lifetime and, for some people, are cosmetically significant and a source of emotional stress. Scars may be dark.

Eczema herpeticum is an infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the skin that is more diffuse and widespread than those in nonatopic patients. Eczema herpeticum is commonly the primary HSV infection, but can also result from recurrent infection, in patients with atopic dermatitis. It manifests as grouped vesicles in areas of active or recent dermatitis, although normal skin can be involved. High fever and adenopathy may develop after several days. Occasionally, this infection can become systemic, which may be fatal. Sometimes the eye is involved, causing a painful corneal lesion.

In newborns, the infection may appear in the diaper area or around the stump of the umbilical cord.  In older children, the face is the typical site of infection.  In adults, the infection may begin anywhere.  In all people with this infection, the skin around the crusted sore becomes red and painful within 1 day. The skin may be extremely tender and have a wrinkled tissue paperâ€“like consistency.  Then, other large areas of skin that are not near the initial site of infection redden and develop large, thin blisters that break easily and start to peel. Blisters frequently develop in areas of friction, such as skinfolds, and on the buttocks, hands, and feet.     The top layer of the skin then begins peeling off, often in large sheets, with even slight touching or gentle pushing. The peeled areas look scalded. Within 2 to 3 days, large areas of the skin surface may be involved, and the person may become ill with a fever, chills, and weakness. With the loss of the protective skin barrier, other bacteria and infective organisms can easily penetrate the body, causing infections in those areas and in other areas, sometimes spreading through the bloodstream (sepsis     Sepsis and Septic Shock  Sepsis is a serious bodywide response to bacteremia or another infection plus malfunction or failure of an essential system in the body.

The cardinal sign is soft-tissue edema, graded in 3 stages:  Stage 1: The edema is pitting, and the affected area often returns to normal by morning. Stage 2: The edema is nonpitting, and chronic soft-tissue inflammation causes early fibrosis. Stage 3: The edema is brawny and irreversible, largely because of soft-tissue fibrosis. The swelling is most often unilateral and may worsen when the weather is warm, before menstruation occurs, and after the limb remains for a long time in a dependent position. It can affect any part of the limb (isolated proximal or distal) or the entire extremity; it can restrict range of motion when swelling is periarticular. Disability and emotional distress can be significant, especially when lymphedema results from medical or surgical treatment.   Skin changes are common and include hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation, verrucae, papillomas, and fungal infections.

Sites of skin picking may change over time. Patterns of skin picking vary from patient to patient. Some have multiple areas of scarring; others focus on only a few lesions. Many patients try to camouflage the skin lesions with clothing or makeup. Skin picking may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals. Patients may search fastidiously for a particular kind of scab to pull; they may try to ensure that the scab is pulled off in a particular way (using either fingers or an implement) and may bite or swallow the scab once it has been pulled off. Patients with excoriation disorder repeatedly try to stop picking their skin or to pick less often, but they are unable to do so. Patients may feel embarrassed by or ashamed of the appearance of the skin-picking sites or of their inability to control their behavior. As a result, patients may avoid social situations in which others may see the skin lesions; they typically do not pick in front of others, except perhaps for family members. Patients may be impaired in other areas of functioning (eg, occupational, academic), mainly because they avoid social situations. Some patients may pick the skin of other people.

When MS is not treated with immunomodulating medications, exacerbations average about 1 every 2 years, but frequency varies greatly. Although MS may progress and regress unpredictably, there are typical patterns of progression:  Relapsing-remitting pattern: Exacerbations alternate with remissions, when partial or full recovery occurs or symptoms are stable. Remissions may last months or years. Exacerbations can occur spontaneously or can be triggered by an infection such as influenza. Relapsing forms of MS include active secondary MS (defined as a clinical relapse or new lesion seen on an MRI scan of the brain or spinal cord). Primary progressive pattern: The disease progresses gradually with no remissions, although there may be temporary plateaus during which the disease does not progress. Unlike in the relapsing-remitting pattern, there are no clear exacerbations. Secondary progressive pattern: This pattern begins with relapses alternating with remissions (relapsing-remitting pattern), followed by gradual progression of the disease. Progressive relapsing pattern: The disease progresses gradually, but progression is interrupted by sudden, clear relapses. This pattern is rare. The most common initial symptoms of multiple sclerosis are the following:  Paresthesias in one or more extremities, in the trunk, or on one side of the face Weakness or clumsiness of a leg or hand Visual disturbances (eg, partial loss of vision and pain in one eye due to retrobulbar optic neuritis, diplopia due to internuclear ophthalmoplegia, scotomas) Other common early symptoms of MS include slight stiffness or unusual fatigability of a limb, minor gait disturbances, vertigo, and mild affective disturbances; all usually indicate scattered CNS involvement and may be subtle.

Excess heat (eg, warm weather, a hot bath, fever) may temporarily exacerbate symptoms and signs (Uhthoff phenomenon). Mild cognitive symptoms are common. Apathy, poor judgment, or inattention may occur. Affective disturbances, including emotional lability, euphoria, or, most commonly, depression, are common. Depression may be reactive or partly due to cerebral lesions of MS. A few patients have seizures.     Cranial nerves    Unilateral or asymmetric optic neuritis and bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia are typical. Central vision is affected more than peripheral vision.

In MS, internuclear ophthalmoplegia is typically bilateral; unilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia is often caused by ischemic stroke. Rapid, small-amplitude eye oscillations in straight-ahead (primary) gaze (pendular nystagmus) are uncommon but characteristic of MS. Vertigo is common. Intermittent unilateral facial numbness or pain (resembling trigeminal neuralgia     Trigeminal Neuralgia  Trigeminal neuralgia is severe paroxysmal, lancinating facial pain due to a disorder of the 5th cranial nerve.

Spastic paraparesis produces a stiff, imbalanced gait; in advanced cases, it may confine patients to a wheelchair. Painful flexor spasms in response to sensory stimuli (eg, bedclothes) may occur late. Cerebral or cervical spinal cord lesions may result in hemiparesis, which sometimes is the presenting symptom. Reduced mobility increases the risk of osteoporosis.       Cerebellar    In advanced MS, cerebellar ataxia plus spasticity may be severely disabling; other cerebellar manifestations include slurred speech, scanning speech (slow enunciation with a tendency to hesitate at the beginning of a word or syllable), and Charcot triad (intention tremor, scanning speech, and nystagmus).       Sensory    Paresthesias and partial loss of any type of sensation are common and often localized (eg, to one or both hands or legs). Various painful sensory disturbances (eg, burning or electric shocklike pains) can occur spontaneously or in response to touch, especially if the spinal cord is affected. An example is Lhermitte sign, an electric shocklike pain that radiates down the spine or into the legs or arms when the neck is flexed. Objective sensory changes tend to be transient and difficult to demonstrate early in the disease.       Spinal cord    Involvement commonly causes bladder dysfunction (eg, urinary urgency or hesitancy, partial retention of urine, mild urinary incontinence). Constipation, erectile dysfunction in men, and genital anesthesia in women may occur. Frank urinary and fecal incontinence may occur in advanced MS. Spinal cord lesions (plaques) are a common source of neuropathic pain. Progressive myelopathy, a variant of MS, causes spinal cord motor weakness but no other deficits.   ",,

The eyebrows, underarms, navel, the skin around the anus, and the cleft where the buttocks meet the lower back may also be affected. Many people with psoriasis may also have deformed, thickened, and pitted nails.    The first patches may clear up after a few months or remain, sometimes growing together to form larger patches. Some people never have more than one or two small patches, and others have patches covering large areas of the body. Thick patches or patches on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or skinfolds of the genitals are more likely to itch or hurt, but many times the person has no symptoms. Although the patches do not cause extreme physical discomfort, they are very obvious and often embarrassing to the person. The psychologic distress caused by psoriasis can be severe. Psoriasis persists throughout life but may come and go. Symptoms of psoriasis are often diminished during the summer when the skin is exposed to bright sunlight. Some people may go for years between occurrences.   About 5 to 30% of people with psoriasis develop arthritis (psoriatic arthritis     Psoriatic Arthritis  Psoriatic arthritis is a spondyloarthritis and a form of joint inflammation that occurs in some people who have psoriasis of the skin or nails. Joint inflammation can develop in people who have...  read more        ). Psoriatic arthritis causes joint pain and swelling.

Erythrodermic psoriasis causes all of the skin on the body to become red and scaly. This form of psoriasis is serious because, like a burn, it keeps the skin from serving as a protective barrier against injury and infection.    Pustular psoriasis is another uncommon form of psoriasis. In this form, large and small pus-filled blisters (pustules) are scattered widely on the body.    Palmoplantar psoriasis is a form of pustular psoriasis in which pustules occur primarily on the hands and feet. It is sometimes called palmoplantar psoriasis of the palms and soles.     Guttate psoriasis is an uncommon form of psoriasis in which multiple, small patches (plaques) appear suddenly, usually on the trunk in children and young adults after a strep throat     Streptococcal Infections  Streptococcal infections are caused by any one of several species of Streptococcus.

The prostate gland may be inflamed and painful. In women, the genital and urinary symptoms, if any occur, are usually mild, consisting of a slight vaginal discharge or uncomfortable urination. The conjunctiva (the membrane that lines the eyelid and covers the eyeball) can become red and inflamed, causing itching or burning and sensitivity to light. Sometimes pain and excessive tearing affect the eye.  Small and usually painless or sometimes tender sores can develop in the mouth and on the tongue. Occasionally, a distinctive rash of hard, thickened spots may develop on the skin, especially of the palms and soles and around the nails (keratoderma blennorrhagicum).

In newborns, the infection may appear in the diaper area or around the stump of the umbilical cord.  In older children, the face is the typical site of infection.  In adults, the infection may begin anywhere.  In all people with this infection, the skin around the crusted sore becomes red and painful within 1 day. The skin may be extremely tender and have a wrinkled tissue paperâ€“like consistency.  Then, other large areas of skin that are not near the initial site of infection redden and develop large, thin blisters that break easily and start to peel. Blisters frequently develop in areas of friction, such as skinfolds, and on the buttocks, hands, and feet.     The top layer of the skin then begins peeling off, often in large sheets, with even slight touching or gentle pushing. The peeled areas look scalded. Within 2 to 3 days, large areas of the skin surface may be involved, and the person may become ill with a fever, chills, and weakness. With the loss of the protective skin barrier, other bacteria and infective organisms can easily penetrate the body, causing infections in those areas and in other areas, sometimes spreading through the bloodstream (sepsis     Sepsis and Septic Shock  Sepsis is a serious bodywide response to bacteremia or another infection plus malfunction or failure of an essential system in the body.

The acute phase begins with fever lasting at least 5 days, usually > 39Â° C (about 102.2Â° F) and unremittent when not treated with antipyretics. The fever is associated with irritability, occasional lethargy, or intermittent colicky abdominal pain. Usually within a day or two of fever onset, bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection appears without exudate. Within 5 days, a polymorphous, erythematous, macular rash appears, primarily over the trunk, often with accentuation in the perineal region. The rash may be urticarial, morbilliform, erythema multiforme, or scarlatiniform. It is accompanied by injected pharynx; reddened, dry, fissured lips; and a red strawberry tongue.     During the first week, pallor of the proximal portion of the fingernails or toenails (leukonychia partialis) may occur. Erythema or a purple-red discoloration and variable edema of the palms and soles usually appear on about the 3rd to 5th day. Although edema may be slight, it is often tense, hard, and nonpitting. The acute phase ends with the resolution of fever.  The subacute phase lasts from the end of the fever until about day 25. Periungual, palmar, plantar, and perineal desquamation begins on about day 10. The superficial layer of the skin sometimes comes off in large casts, revealing new normal skin. Arthritis, arthralgia, and thrombocytosis may be present. Arthritis or arthralgias (mainly involving large joints) occur in about 33% of patients.  Cardiac manifestations usually begin in the subacute phase of the syndrome about 1 to 4 weeks after onset as the rash, fever, and other early acute clinical symptoms begin to subside. Tender, nonsuppurative cervical lymphadenopathy (â‰¥ 1 node â‰¥ 1.5 cm in diameter) is present throughout the course in about 50% of patients. The illness may last from 2 to 12 weeks or longer. Incomplete or atypical cases can occur, especially in younger infants, who have higher risk of developing coronary artery disease. These findings manifest in about 90% of patients. Other less specific findings indicate involvement of many systems. Other clinical features may include urethritis, aseptic meningitis, hepatitis, otitis, vomiting, diarrhea, hydrops of the gallbladder, upper respiratory symptoms, and anterior uveitis. The convalescent phase begins when clinical signs disappear and continues until about 6 to 8 weeks after the onset of the acute phase. ",,

A fever of 103 to 105Â° F (about 39.5 to 40.5Â° C) begins abruptly and lasts for 3 to 5 days. In 5 to 15% of children, seizures occur as a result of high fever, particularly because the fever begins and rises quickly. Despite the high fever, the child is usually alert and active.  A few children have a mild runny nose, sore throat, or an upset stomach.  The lymph nodes at the back of the head, the sides of the neck, and behind the ears may be enlarged.  The fever usually decreases rapidly on the fourth day.   About 30% of children with roseola infantum develop a rash within a few hours to, at most, a day after the temperature falls. The rash is red and flat. It occurs mostly on the chest and abdomen and less extensively on the face, arms, and legs. The rash is not itchy and may last from a few hours to 2 days. ",,

Skin changes    Systemic sclerosis can damage large areas of skin or only the fingers (sclerodactyly). Sometimes systemic sclerosis tends to stay restricted to the skin of the hands. Other times, the disorder progresses. The skin becomes more widely taut, shiny, and darker than usual. The skin on the face tightens, sometimes resulting in an inability to change facial expressions. However, in some people, the skin can soften over time. Sometimes dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia often referred to as spider veins) can appear on the fingers, chest, face, lips, and tongue, and bumps composed of calcium can develop on the fingers, on other bony areas, or at the joints. Sores can develop on the fingertips and knuckles.

Severe disease is characterized by dysphagia, dysphonia, and/or diaphragmatic weakness. Muscle weakness may progress over weeks to months. However, it takes destruction of 50% of muscle fibers to cause symptomatic weakness (ie, muscle weakness indicates advanced myositis). Patients may have difficulty raising their arms above their shoulders, climbing steps, or rising from a sitting position. Sometimes muscle tenderness and atrophy develop. Patients may require the use of a wheelchair or become bedridden because of weakness of pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. The flexors of the neck may be severely affected, causing an inability to raise the head from the pillow. Involvement of pharyngeal and upper esophageal muscles may impair swallowing and predispose to aspiration. Muscles of the hands, feet, and face are not involved except in inclusion body myositis, in which distal involvement, especially of the hands, is characteristic. Limb contractures rarely develop. Joint manifestations include polyarthralgia or polyarthritis with swelling and other characteristics of nondeforming arthritis.

Cardiac involvement, especially conduction disturbances and ventricular dysfunction, can occur. Gastrointestinal symptoms, more common among children, are due to an associated vasculitis and may include abdominal pain, hematemesis, melena, and ischemic bowel perforation. Skin changes, which occur in dermatomyositis, tend to be dusky and erythematous. Photosensitivity and skin ulceration are visible. Periorbital edema with a purplish appearance (heliotrope rash) is relatively specific for dermatomyositis. Elsewhere, the rash may be slightly elevated and smooth or scaly; it may appear on the forehead, V of the neck and shoulders, chest and back, forearms and lower legs, lateral thighs, elbows and knees, medial malleoli, and dorsal aspects of the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints (Gottron papulesâ€”a relatively specific finding). The base and sides of the fingernails may be hyperemic or thickened. Desquamating dermatitis with splitting of the skin may evolve over the radial aspects of the fingers. Subcutaneous and muscle calcification may occur, particularly in children. The primary skin lesions frequently fade completely but may be followed by secondary changes (eg, brownish pigmentation, atrophy, persistent neovascularization, scarring). Rash on the scalp may appear psoriaform and be intensely pruritic.  Characteristic skin changes can occur in the absence of muscle disease, in which case the disease is called amyopathic dermatomyositis.

Systemic symptoms include generalized afternoon fatigue and malaise, anorexia, generalized weakness, and occasionally low-grade fever. Joint symptoms include pain, swelling, and stiffness. Occasionally, the disease begins abruptly, mimicking an acute viral syndrome. The disease progresses most rapidly during the first 6 years, particularly the first year; 80% of patients develop some permanent joint abnormalities within 10 years. The course is unpredictable in individual patients. Joint symptoms are characteristically symmetric. Typically, stiffness lasts > 60 minutes after rising in the morning but may occur after any prolonged inactivity (called gelling). Involved joints become tender, with erythema, warmth, swelling, and limitation of motion. The joints primarily involved include the following:  Wrists and the index (2nd) and middle (3rd) metacarpophalangeal joints (most commonly involved) Proximal interphalangeal joints Metatarsophalangeal joint Shoulders Elbows Hips Knees Ankles However, virtually any joint, except the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, may be involved.

It may be confined to the fingers (sclerodactyly) and hands, or it may affect most or all of the body. The skin eventually becomes taut, shiny, and hypopigmented or hyperpigmented; the face becomes masklike; and telangiectases may appear on the fingers, chest, face, lips, and tongue. However, in some patients, skin can soften to variable degrees. Subcutaneous calcifications may develop, usually on the fingertips (pulps) and over bony eminences. Digital ulcers are common, especially on the fingertips, overlying the finger joints, or over calcinotic nodules.

The lesion slowly enlarges, often ulcerates, and may spread to other skin areas. Lesions heal slowly, with scarring. Secondary infections with other bacteria are common and can cause extensive tissue destruction. Lymphadenopathy is uncommon. Occasionally, granuloma inguinale spreads through the bloodstream to the bones, joints, or liver; without treatment, anemia, wasting, and, uncommonly, death may occur.

Not all bites inject venom, but if the wound oozes, venom was probably injected. Redness and swelling usually follow within 30 to 60 minutes and can affect the entire leg or arm within several hours. Moderate or severe pit viper poisoning commonly causes bruising of the skin 3 to 6 hours after the bite. The skin around the bite appears tight and discolored. Blisters, often filled with blood, may form in the bite area. Without treatment, tissue around the bite may be destroyed. Other symptoms include fever, chills, general weakness, faintness, sweating, anxiety, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some of these symptoms may be caused by terror rather than venom. The gums may bleed, and blood may appear in the personâ€™s vomit, stools, and urine. Breathing difficulties can occur, particularly after Mojave rattlesnake bites. Some people may have chest pain. Hours later, people may have a headache, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, and a dry mouth.    People bitten by a rattlesnake may experience tingling and numbness in the fingers or toes or around the mouth and a metallic or rubbery taste in the mouth.       Coral snakes    Coral snakebites usually cause little or no immediate pain and swelling. More severe symptoms may take several hours to develop. The area around the bite may tingle, and nearby muscles may become weak. Muscle incoordination and severe general weakness may follow. Other symptoms may include double vision, blurred vision, confusion, drowsiness, increased saliva production, and speech and swallowing difficulties. Breathing problems, which may be extreme, may develop.        Is That a Pit Viper?    Pit vipers have certain features that can help distinguish them from nonvenomous snakes:   Vertical slitlike pupils Pits between the eyes and nose Retractable fangs Rows of single scales across the underside of the tail Triangular heads (like an arrowhead) Nonvenomous snakes tend to have the following:   Rounded heads Round pupils No pits No fangs Rows of double scales across the underside of the tail If people see a snake with no fangs, they should not assume it is nonvenomous because the fangs may be retracted.

Multiple lesions may occur after multiple infective bites or with metastatic spread. Their appearance varies. The initial lesion is often a papule that slowly enlarges, ulcerates centrally, and develops a raised, erythematous border where intracellular parasites are concentrated. Ulcers are typically painless and cause no systemic symptoms unless secondarily infected. Lesions heal spontaneously after several months but may persist for years. They leave a depressed, burn-like scar. The course depends on the infecting Leishmania species and the hostâ€™s immune status.  Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, a rare syndrome, results in widespread nodular skin lesions resembling those of lepromatous leprosy     Leprosy  Leprosy is a chronic infection usually caused by the acid-fast bacilli Mycobacterium leprae or the closely related organism M. lepromatosis. These organisms have a unique tropism...  read more        . It results from cell-mediated anergy to the organism. Mucosal leishmaniasis due to L. braziliensis and related organisms typically starts with one or more primary cutaneous ulcers. Spread to the mucosa via lymphatics and the bloodstream probably occurs early in infection. The skin lesions heal spontaneously; but progressive mucosal lesions may not become apparent for months to years. Typically, patients have nasal stuffiness, discharge, and pain. Over time, the infection may progress, resulting in gross mutilation of the nose, palate, oral pharynx, or face. In visceral leishmaniasis, the clinical manifestations usually develop gradually over weeks to months after inoculation of the parasite but can be acute. Irregular fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with a reversed albumin:globulin ratio occur. In some patients, there are twice-daily temperature spikes. Cutaneous skin lesions rarely occur. Emaciation and death occur within months to years in patients with progressive infections. Those with asymptomatic, self-resolving infections and survivors (after successful treatment) are resistant to further attacks unless cell-mediated immunity is impaired (eg, by AIDS). Relapse may occur years after initial infection.  Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may develop after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis in patients in the Sudan and India. It is characterized by flat or nodular cutaneous lesions that contain many parasites. In patients in the Sudan, these lesions develop at the end of or within 6 months of therapy and spontaneously resolve a few months to a year later. In patients in India and adjacent countries, skin lesions typically develop 1 to 2 years after therapy ends and can last for many years. PKDL lesions are thought to be a reservoir for the spread of infection in these areas.  ",,

In other people, patches appear over a large part of the body. Rarely, vitiligo occurs over most of the skin surface. The changes are most striking in people with darker skin. Commonly affected areas are the face, fingers and toes, wrists, elbows, knees, hands, shins, ankles, armpits, anus and genital area, navel, and nipples. The affected skin is extremely prone to sunburn. The areas of skin affected by vitiligo also produce white hair because melanocytes are lost from the hair follicles.     Manifestations of Vitiligo             Vitiligo  The white spots on the ankle are vitiligo, which is caused by loss of skin pigmentâ€“producing cells (melanocytes).

Eczema herpeticum is an infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the skin that is more diffuse and widespread than those in nonatopic patients. Eczema herpeticum is commonly the primary HSV infection, but can also result from recurrent infection, in patients with atopic dermatitis. It manifests as grouped vesicles in areas of active or recent dermatitis, although normal skin can be involved. High fever and adenopathy may develop after several days. Occasionally, this infection can become systemic, which may be fatal. Sometimes the eye is involved, causing a painful corneal lesion.

Patients with atopic dermatitis also have a higher risk of allergic contact reactions. For example, contact allergies to nickel, the most common contact allergen, are twice as common as in nonatopic patients. Frequent use of topical products exposes patients to many potential allergens, and allergic contact dermatitis caused by these products may complicate the treatment of atopic dermatitis.   ",,

On average, symptoms appear 5 to 7 years after infection but may take 20 to 30 years. Once symptoms begin, they progress slowly. Leprosy affects mainly the skin and peripheral nerves (the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord). Characteristic rashes and bumps develop. They are not itchy. Infection of the nerves makes the skin numb or the muscles weak in areas controlled by the infected nerves. Specific symptoms vary depending on the type of leprosy.  Tuberculoid leprosy: A rash appears, consisting of one or a few flat, lighter areas with sharp, raised borders. Areas affected by this rash are numb because the bacteria damage the underlying nerves. Lepromatous leprosy: Many small or larger raised bumps of variable size and shape appear on the skin. There are more areas of numbness than in tuberculoid leprosy, and certain muscle groups may be weak. Much of the skin and many areas of the body, including the kidneys, nose, and testes, may be affected. In affected men, the breasts may enlarge. People may lose their eyelashes and eyebrows. Borderline leprosy: Features of both tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy are present. Without treatment, borderline leprosy may become less severe and more like the tuberculoid form, or it may worsen and become more like the lepromatous form.    Complications of leprosy    The most severe complications result from infection of the peripheral nerves, which causes deterioration of the sense of touch and a corresponding inability to feel pain and temperature. People with peripheral nerve damage may unknowingly burn, cut, or otherwise harm themselves. Repeated damage may eventually lead to loss of fingers and toes. Also, damage to peripheral nerves may cause muscle weakness that can result in deformities. For example, the fingers may be weakened, causing them to curve inward (like a claw). Muscles may become too weak to flex the footâ€”a condition called foot drop. Infected nerves may enlarge so that during a physical examination, doctors can feel them.     Images of Leprosy             Tuberculoid Leprosy  Tuberculoid leprosy causes a rash consisting of lighter areas with sharp, raised borders. Areas affected by this rash are numb because the bacteria damage the nerves underneath.

Lebrun via the Public Health Image Library of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.                      Skin infection can lead to areas of swelling and lumps, which can be particularly disfiguring on the face. Other areas of the body may be affected:  Feet: Sores may also develop on the soles of the feet, making walking painful. Nose: Damage to the nasal passages can result in a chronically stuffy nose and nosebleeds and, if untreated, complete erosion of the nose. Eyes: Damage to the eyes may lead to glaucoma     Glaucoma  Glaucomas are a group of eye disorders characterized by progressive optic nerve damage (often, but not always, associated with increased eye pressure) that can lead to irreversible loss of vision...  read more      or blindness. Sexual function: Men with lepromatous leprosy may have erectile dysfunction (impotence) and become infertile. The infection can reduce the amount of testosterone and sperm produced by the testes.

Leprosy reactions    During the course of untreated or even treated leprosy, the immune system may produce inflammatory reactions. These reactions can cause fever and inflammation of the skin, peripheral nerves, and, less commonly, the lymph nodes, joints, testes, kidneys, liver, and eyes. The reactions can also contribute to nerve damage. The skin around bumps may swell and become red and painful, and the bumps may form open sores. People may have a fever, swollen lymph glands, and painful joints.   ",,

Sometimes all the scalp hair is lost (alopecia totalis), hair is lost from around the side and back edges of the scalp (ophiasis), or hair is lost on the top of the head but not at the edges of the scalp (sisaipho). Rarely, all body hair is lost (a condition called alopecia universalis).   The nails may become pitted or rough, or the half moon at the base of the nails (the lunula) may be red.  ",,

SLE may develop abruptly with fever or insidiously over months or years with episodes of arthralgias and malaise. Vascular headaches, epilepsy, or psychoses may be initial findings. Manifestations referable to any organ system may appear. Periodic exacerbations (flares) may occur.     Joint manifestations    Joint symptoms, ranging from intermittent arthralgias to acute polyarthritis, occur in about 90% of patients and may precede other manifestations by years.

Erythema may look more purple or brown on dark skin than on light skin. Lesions initially are 2 to 4 mm in diameter, with angular borders and a distinct sheen in cross-lighting.  They are usually symmetrically distributed, most commonly on the flexor surfaces of the wrists, legs, trunk, glans penis, and oral and vaginal mucosae but can be widespread. The face is rarely involved. Onset may be abrupt or gradual.  Children are affected infrequently.

Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD.                            During the acute phase, new papules may appear at sites of minor skin injury (Koebner phenomenon), such as a superficial scratch. Lesions may coalesce or change over time, becoming hyperpigmented, atrophic, hyperkeratotic (hypertrophic lichen planus), or vesiculobullous. Although pruritic, lesions are rarely excoriated or crusted. If the scalp is affected, patchy scarring alopecia (lichen planopilaris) may occur.  The oral mucosa is involved in about 50% of cases; oral lesions may occur without cutaneous lesions. Reticulated, lacy, bluish white, linear lesions (Wickham striae) are a hallmark of oral lichen planus, especially on the buccal mucosae. Tongue margins and gingival mucosae in edentulous areas may also be affected. An erosive form of lichen planus may occur in which the patient develops shallow, often painful, recurrent oral ulcers, which, if long-standing, rarely become cancerous. Chronic exacerbations and remissions are common.    Vulvar and vaginal mucosae are often involved. Up to 50% of women with oral mucosal findings have undiagnosed vulvar lichen planus. In men, genital involvement is common, especially of the glans penis. Nails are involved in up to 10% of cases. Findings vary in intensity with nail bed discoloration, longitudinal ridging and lateral thinning, and complete loss of the nail matrix and nail, with scarring of the proximal nail fold onto the nail bed (pterygium formation).

Patterns of hair loss vary from patient to patient. Some have areas of complete alopecia or missing eyelashes and/or eyebrows; others merely have thinned hair. A range of behaviors (rituals) may accompany hair pulling. Patients may search fastidiously for a particular kind of hair to pull; they may try to ensure that hair is pulled out in a particular way. They may roll the hair between their fingers, pull the strands between their teeth, or bite the hair once it is pulled. Many patients swallow their hair.

Many try to camouflage the hair loss by covering the bald areas (eg, wearing wigs or scarfs). Some patients pull out hair from widely scattered areas to disguise the loss. They may avoid situations in which other people may see the hair loss; typically, they do not pull hair out in front of others, except perhaps for family members.

The skin around the blisters is often red.      Oral infection    The first oral infection with HSV usually causes many painful sores inside the mouth (herpetic gingivostomatitis). Herpetic gingivostomatitis most commonly develops in children. Before the sores appear, people may feel a tingling discomfort or itching in the area. In addition, people usually feel sick and have a fever, a headache, and body aches.  The mouth sores last 10 to 19 days and are often very severe, making eating and drinking extremely uncomfortable. As a result, people may become dehydrated. Occasionally, no symptoms develop. Recurrences usually produce a cluster of sores on the rim of the lip. The sores then rupture and crust over. The lip sore is called a cold sore or fever blister (so named because they are often triggered by colds or fevers). Other triggers include sunburn on the lips, anxiety, certain dental procedures, and any condition that reduces the body's resistance to infection.   Before a cold sore appears, people usually feel a tingling at the site, lasting from minutes to a few hours, followed by redness and swelling. Usually, fluid-filled blisters form and break open, leaving sores. The sores quickly form a scab. After about 5 to 10 days, the scab falls off and the episode ends. Less often, tingling and redness occur without blister formation.

Internal blisters are less painful and are not visible. The blisters develop 4 to 7 days after people are infected. The blisters go away but may come back (recur) because the virus never truly leaves the body. Blisters caused by a first genital infection are usually more painful, last longer, and are more widespread than those caused by a recurrent infection. In people with a weakened immune system, recurrences of oral or genital herpes can result in progressive, gradually enlarging sores that take weeks to heal. The infection may progress inside the body, moving into the esophagus, lungs, or colon. Ulcers in the esophagus cause pain during swallowing, and lung infection causes pneumonia with cough and shortness of breath.

In men, warts usually occur on the penis, especially under the foreskin in uncircumcised men, or in the urethra. In all people, genital warts may develop in the area around and inside the anus, especially in people who engage in anal sex. Genital warts are usually caused by types of HPV that are unlikely to cause cancer.  Warts cause no symptoms in many people but cause occasional burning pain, itching, or discomfort in some.  Genital warts are easily visible and are often noticed by the person with the warts. The warts usually appear 1 to 6 months after infection with HPV, beginning as tiny, soft, moist, pink or gray growths. They grow rapidly and become rough, irregular bumps, which sometimes grow out from the skin on narrow stalks. Their rough surfaces make them look like a small cauliflower. Warts often grow in clusters.   Warts may grow more rapidly and spread more widely in pregnant women and in people who have a weakened immune system, such as those who have HIV infection.

0,Herpes HPV and other STDs,Syphilis,https://www.msdmanuals.com/en-sg/professional/infectious-diseases/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis/syphilis,https://www.msdmanuals.com/en-sg/professional/infectious-diseases/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis/syphilis,"  Syphilis may manifest at any stage and may affect multiple or single organs, mimicking many other disorders. Syphilis may be accelerated by coexisting HIV infection; in these cases, eye involvement, meningitis, and other neurologic complications are more common and more severe. Syphilis should be suspected in patients with typical mucocutaneous lesions or unexplained neurologic disorders, particularly in areas where the infection is prevalent. In such areas, it should also be considered in patients with a broad range of unexplained findings. Because clinical manifestations are so diverse and advanced stages are now relatively rare in most developed countries, syphilis may escape recognition.

Image courtesy of the Public Health Image Library of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.                            Primary syphilis    After an incubation period of 3 to 4 weeks (range 1 to 13 weeks), a primary lesion (chancre) develops at the site of inoculation. The initial red papule quickly forms a chancre, usually a painless ulcer with a firm base; when rubbed, it produces clear fluid containing numerous spirochetes. Nearby lymph nodes may be enlarged, firm, and nontender. Chancres can occur anywhere but are most common on the following:  Penis, anus, and rectum in men Vulva, cervix, rectum, and perineum in women Lips or mouth About half of infected women and one third of infected men are unaware of the chancre because it causes few symptoms. Chancres in the rectum or mouth, usually occurring in men, are often unnoticed. The chancre usually heals in 3 to 12 weeks. Then, people appear to be completely healthy.       Secondary syphilis    The spirochete spreads in the bloodstream, producing widespread mucocutaneous lesions, lymph node swelling, and, less commonly, symptoms in other organs. Symptoms typically begin 6 to 12 weeks after the chancre appears; about 25% of patients still have a chancre. Fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and fatigue are common. Headache (due to meningitis), hearing loss (due to otitis), balance problems (due to labyrinthitis), visual disturbances (due to retinitis or uveitis), and bone pain (due to periostitis) can also occur. Over 80% of patients have mucocutaneous lesions; a wide variety of rashes and lesions occur, and any body surface can be affected. Without treatment, lesions may disappear in a few days to weeks, persist for months, or return after healing, but all eventually heal, usually without scarring. Syphilitic dermatitis is usually symmetric and more marked on the palms and soles. The individual lesions are round, often scale, and may coalesce to produce larger lesions, but they generally do not itch or hurt. After lesions resolve, the affected areas may be lighter or darker than normal. If the scalp is involved, alopecia areata often occurs. Condyloma lata are hypertrophic, flattened, dull pink or gray papules at mucocutaneous junctions and in moist areas of the skin (eg, in the perianal area, under the breasts); lesions are extremely infectious. Lesions of the mouth, throat, larynx, penis, vulva, or rectum are usually circular, raised, and often gray to white with a red border. Secondary syphilis can affect many other organs:  About half of patients have lymphadenopathy, usually generalized, with nontender, firm, discrete nodes, and often hepatosplenomegaly. About 10% of patients have lesions in other organs, such as the eyes (uveitis), bones (periostitis), joints, meninges, kidneys (glomerulitis), liver (hepatitis), or spleen. About 10 to 30% of patients have mild meningitis, but < 1% have meningeal symptoms, which can include headache, neck stiffness, cranial nerve lesions, deafness, and eye inflammation (eg, optic neuritis, retinitis). However, acute or subacute meningitis is more common among patients with HIV infection and may manifest as meningeal symptoms or strokes due to intracranial vasculitis.

Latent period    Latent syphilis can be early (< 1 year after infection) or late (â‰¥ 1 year after infection). Symptoms and signs are absent, but antibodies, detected by serologic tests for syphilis (STS), persist. Because symptoms of primary and secondary syphilis are often minimal or ignored, patients frequently are first diagnosed during the latent stage when routine blood tests for syphilis are done. Syphilis may remain latent permanently, but relapses with contagious skin or mucosal lesions may occur during the early latent period. Patients are often given antibiotics for other disorders, which may cure latent syphilis and may account for the rarity of late-stage disease in developed countries.       Late or tertiary syphilis    About one third of untreated people develop late syphilis, although not until years to decades after the initial infection. Lesions may be clinically classified as   Benign tertiary syphilis Cardiovascular syphilis Neurosyphilis  Benign tertiary gummatous syphilis usually develops within 3 to 10 years of infection and may involve the skin, bones, and internal organs. Gummas are soft, destructive, inflammatory masses that are typically localized but may diffusely infiltrate an organ or tissue; they grow and heal slowly and leave scars.   Benign tertiary syphilis of bone results in either inflammation or destructive lesions that cause a deep, boring pain, characteristically worse at night.  Cardiovascular syphilis usually manifests 10 to 25 years after the initial infection as any of the following:  Aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta Insufficiency of the aortic valve Narrowing of the coronary arteries Pulsations of the dilated aorta may cause symptoms by compressing or eroding adjacent structures in the chest. Symptoms include brassy cough and obstruction of breathing due to pressure on the trachea, hoarseness due to vocal cord paralysis resulting from compression of the left laryngeal nerve, and painful erosion of the sternum and ribs or spine. Neurosyphilis has several forms:  Asymptomatic neurosyphilis Meningovascular neurosyphilis Parenchymatous neurosyphilis Tabes dorsalis Asymptomatic neurosyphilis causes mild meningitis     Overview of Meningitis  Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space. It may result from infections, other disorders, or reactions to drugs. Severity and acuity vary. Findings typically include...  read more      in about 15% of patients originally diagnosed as having latent syphilis, in 25 to 40% of those with secondary syphilis, in 12% of those with cardiovascular syphilis, and in 5% of those with benign tertiary syphilis. Without treatment, it evolves to symptomatic neurosyphilis in 5%. If cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination does not detect evidence of meningitis 2 years after the initial infection, neurosyphilis is unlikely to develop. Meningovascular neurosyphilis results from inflammation of large- to medium-sized arteries of the brain or spinal cord; symptoms typically occur 5 to 10 years after infection and range from none to strokes. Initial symptoms may include headache, neck stiffness, dizziness, behavioral abnormalities, poor concentration, memory loss, lassitude, insomnia, and blurred vision. Spinal cord involvement may cause weakness and wasting of shoulder-girdle and arm muscles, slowly progressive leg weakness with urinary or fecal incontinence or both, and, rarely, sudden paralysis of the legs due to thrombosis of spinal arteries. Parenchymatous neurosyphilis (general paresis, or dementia paralytica) results when chronic meningoencephalitis causes destruction of cortical parenchyma. It usually develops 15 to 20 years after initial infection and typically does not affect patients before their 40s or 50s. Behavior progressively deteriorates, sometimes mimicking a mental disorder or dementia. Irritability, difficulty concentrating, deterioration of memory, defective judgment, headaches, insomnia, fatigue, and lethargy are common; seizures, aphasia, and transient hemiparesis are possible. Hygiene and grooming deteriorate. Patients may become emotionally unstable and depressed and have delusions of grandeur with lack of insight; wasting may occur. Tremors of the mouth, tongue, outstretched hands, and whole body may occur; other signs include pupillary abnormalities, dysarthria, hyperreflexia, and, in some patients, extensor plantar responses. Handwriting is usually shaky and illegible. Tabes dorsalis (locomotor ataxia) involves slow, progressive degeneration of the posterior columns and nerve roots. It typically develops 20 to 30 years after initial infection; mechanism is unknown. Usually, the earliest, most characteristic symptom is an intense, stabbing (lightning) pain in the back and legs that recurs irregularly with loss of vibratory sense, proprioception, and reflexes in the lower extremities. Gait ataxia, hyperesthesia, and paresthesia may produce a sensation of walking on foam rubber. Loss of bladder sensation leads to urine retention, incontinence, and recurrent infections. Erectile dysfunction is common. Most patients with tabes dorsalis are thin and have characteristic sad facies and Argyll Robertson pupils (pupils that accommodate for near vision but do not respond to light). Optic atrophy may occur. Examination of the legs detects hypotonia, hyporeflexia, impaired vibratory and joint position sense, ataxia in the heel-shin test, absence of deep pain sensation, and Romberg sign. Tabes dorsalis tends to be intractable even with treatment. Visceral crises (episodic pain) are a variant of tabes dorsalis; paroxysms of pain occur in various organs, most commonly in the stomach (causing vomiting) but also in the rectum, bladder, and larynx.       Other lesions    Syphilitic ocular and otic manifestations can occur at any stage of the disease. Ocular syndromes can affect virtually any part of the eye; they include interstitial keratitis     Interstitial Keratitis  Interstitial keratitis is chronic, nonulcerative inflammation of the mid-stroma (the middle layers of the cornea) that is sometimes associated with uveitis.

Patients with ocular syphilis are at risk of neurosyphilis. Otosyphilis may affect the cochlea (causing hearing loss and tinnitus) or vestibular system (causing vertigo and nystagmus). Trophic lesions, secondary to hypoesthesia of the skin or periarticular tissues, may develop in the later stages. Trophic ulcers may develop on the soles of the feet and penetrate as deeply as the underlying bone.

Small, painful blisters form on the genitals or around the anus and rapidly rupture to form shallow, open sores with ragged edges. These sores may enlarge and join together. Occasionally, these sores become deeper and damage other tissues. The lymph nodes in the groin may form a bubo (an enlarged and tender group of regional lymph nodes). They sometimes become matted together, in some cases forming a collection of pus (abscess). The skin over the abscess may become red and shiny and may break down and discharge pus from the lymph nodes onto the skin. Sores may also form in other areas of the skin. ",,

In a few people, infection spreads through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, especially to the skin, joints, or both. Some men (about 25%) have minimal symptoms. Symptoms begin within about 2 to 14 days after infection. Men feel mild discomfort in the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body). This discomfort is followed a few hours later by mild to severe pain during urination, a yellow-green discharge of pus from the penis, and a frequent urge to urinate. The opening at the tip of the penis may become red and swollen. The bacteria sometimes spread to the epididymis     Epididymitis and Epididymo-orchitis  Epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis (the coiled tube on top of the testis that provides the space and environment for sperm to mature), and epididymo-orchitis is inflammation of the...  read more      (the coiled tube on top of each testis), causing the scrotum to swell and feel tender to the touch. Some women (about 10 to 20%) have minimal or no symptoms. Thus, gonorrhea may be detected only during routine screening or after diagnosis of the infection in their partner. Symptoms typically do not begin until at least 10 days after infection. Some women feel only mild discomfort in the genital area and have a yellow or green vaginal discharge. However, other women have more severe symptoms, such as a frequent urge to urinate or pain during urination. These symptoms develop when the urethra is also infected. The infection may spread up the reproductive tract and infect the uterus, the tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes), and sometimes the area around the ovaries. In some women, the infection spreads to the lining of the pelvis and abdominal cavity (peritoneum), causing peritonitis.

The inflammation has many causes ranging from infection to radiation therapy. Depending on its cause, proctitis can be...  read more     ). This infection usually causes no symptoms, but it may make bowel movements painful. Other symptoms include constipation, itching, bleeding, and a discharge from the rectum. The area around the anus may become red and raw, and stool may be coated with mucus and pus. When a doctor examines the rectum with a viewing tube (anoscope), mucus and pus may be visible on the wall of the rectum. Oral sex with an infected partner may result in gonorrhea of the throat (gonococcal pharyngitis). Usually, these infections cause no symptoms, but the throat may be sore. If infected fluids come into contact with the eyes, gonococcal conjunctivitis may develop, causing swelling of the eyelids and a discharge of pus from the eyes. In adults, often only one eye is infected. Newborns usually have infection in both eyes. Blindness may result if the infection is not treated early. Rarely, disseminated gonococcal infection (arthritis-dermatitis syndrome) develops. It occurs when the infection spreads through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, especially the skin and joints; rarely, infection spreads to the heart. Joints become swollen, tender, and extremely painful, limiting movement. The skin over infected joints may be red and warm. People typically have a fever, feel generally ill, and develop joint pain (due to arthritis) in one or more joints. Small, red spots may appear on the skin, usually on the arms and legs. The spots are slightly painful and may be filled with pus. Joint, bloodstream, and heart infections can be treated, but recovery from arthritis may be slow.   Gonococcal septic arthritis is a form of disseminated gonococcal infection that causes painful arthritis. Usually, it affects one or two large joints, such as the knees, ankles, wrists, or elbows, Symptoms often begin suddenly. People usually have a fever. Infected joints are painful and swollen, and movement is limited. The skin over the infected joints may be warm and red. In children, gonorrhea is usually a sign of sexual abuse. In girls, the genital area (vulva) may be irritated, red, and swollen, and they may have a discharge from the vagina. If the urethra is infected, children, mainly boys, may have pain during urination. ",,

The skin around the blisters is often red.      Oral infection    The first oral infection with HSV usually causes many painful sores inside the mouth (herpetic gingivostomatitis). Herpetic gingivostomatitis most commonly develops in children. Before the sores appear, people may feel a tingling discomfort or itching in the area. In addition, people usually feel sick and have a fever, a headache, and body aches.  The mouth sores last 10 to 19 days and are often very severe, making eating and drinking extremely uncomfortable. As a result, people may become dehydrated. Occasionally, no symptoms develop. Recurrences usually produce a cluster of sores on the rim of the lip. The sores then rupture and crust over. The lip sore is called a cold sore or fever blister (so named because they are often triggered by colds or fevers). Other triggers include sunburn on the lips, anxiety, certain dental procedures, and any condition that reduces the body's resistance to infection.   Before a cold sore appears, people usually feel a tingling at the site, lasting from minutes to a few hours, followed by redness and swelling. Usually, fluid-filled blisters form and break open, leaving sores. The sores quickly form a scab. After about 5 to 10 days, the scab falls off and the episode ends. Less often, tingling and redness occur without blister formation.

Internal blisters are less painful and are not visible. The blisters develop 4 to 7 days after people are infected. The blisters go away but may come back (recur) because the virus never truly leaves the body. Blisters caused by a first genital infection are usually more painful, last longer, and are more widespread than those caused by a recurrent infection. In people with a weakened immune system, recurrences of oral or genital herpes can result in progressive, gradually enlarging sores that take weeks to heal. The infection may progress inside the body, moving into the esophagus, lungs, or colon. Ulcers in the esophagus cause pain during swallowing, and lung infection causes pneumonia with cough and shortness of breath.

Lesions consist of clusters of pink, dome-shaped, smooth, waxy, or pearly and umbilicated papules, usually 2 to 5 mm in diameter, which occur most commonly on the face, trunk, and extremities in children and on the pubis, penis, or vulva in adults. Lesions may grow to 10 to 15 mm in diameter, especially among patients with HIV infection and other immunodeficiencies.

Most types are usually asymptomatic. However, some warts are tender, so those on weight-bearing surfaces (eg, bottom of the feet) may cause mild pain.

They are usually asymptomatic but sometimes cause mild pain when they are located on a weight-bearing surface (eg, bottom of the feet).  Common warts are sharply demarcated, rough, round or irregular, firm, and light gray, yellow, brown, or gray-black nodules 2 to 10 mm in diameter. They appear most often on sites subject to trauma (eg, fingers, elbows, knees, face) but may spread elsewhere. Variants of unusual shape (eg, pedunculated or resembling a cauliflower) appear most frequently on the head and neck, especially the scalp and beard area.         Palmar warts and plantar warts    These warts are caused by HPV types 1, 2, and 4. They occur on the palms and soles.  Palmar and plantar warts are flattened by pressure and surrounded by cornified epithelium. They are often tender, and plantar warts can make walking and standing uncomfortable. They can be distinguished from corns and calluses     Calluses and Corns  Calluses and corns are circumscribed areas of hyperkeratosis at a site of intermittent pressure or friction.

Flat warts (plane warts)    Flat warts are caused by HPV types 3 and 10 and occasionally 26 to 29 and 41. They are more common among children and young adults and develop by autoinoculation. These warts are smooth, flat-topped, yellow-brown, pink, or skin-colored papules, most often located on the face and along scratch marks.  They generally cause no symptoms but are usually difficult to treat.         Mosaic warts    Mosaic warts are plaques formed by the coalescence of myriad smaller, closely set plantar warts. As with other plantar warts, they are often tender.       Filiform warts    These warts are long, narrow, frondlike growths, usually located on the eyelids, face, neck, or lips. They are usually asymptomatic.  This morphologically distinct variant of the common wart is benign and easy to treat.         Periungual warts    Periungual warts are caused by HPV types 1, 2, 4, and 7.  These warts appear as thickened, fissured, cauliflower-like skin around the nail plate. They are usually asymptomatic, but the fissures cause pain as the warts enlarge. Patients frequently lose the cuticle and are susceptible to paronychia     Acute Paronychia  Paronychia is infection of the periungual tissues.

About half of patients have only oral erosions, which rupture and remain as chronic, painful lesions for variable periods. Often, oral lesions precede skin involvement. Dysphagia and poor oral intake are common because lesions also may occur in the upper esophagus. Cutaneous bullae typically arise in normal-appearing skin, rupture, and leave a raw area with crusting. Itching is usually absent. Erosions often become infected. If large portions of the body are affected, fluid and electrolyte loss may be significant. A rare variant called pemphigus vegetans occurs primarily in intertriginous areas and oral mucosa with vegetating cauliflower-like plaques.

Skin lesions may not develop for several years. Often, characteristic tense bullae develop on skin of the trunk and in the flexural and intertriginous areas. Bullae may develop on normal-appearing skin or may be preceded by erythematous or urticarial-appearing plaques. Localized disease may occur at trauma sites, stomas, and anogenital and lower leg areas. Dyshidrotic pemphigoid is a rare form of bullous pemphigoid that affects the hands and feet and can look like dyshidrotic dermatitis (a form of hand and foot dermatitis     Hand and Foot Dermatitis  Hand and foot dermatitis is a dermatitis affecting the hands and/or feet.

Bullae usually do not rupture, but those that do often rapidly heal.  Polymorphic, annular, dusky-red, edematous lesions, with or without peripheral vesicles, can occur. Rarely, small blisters develop on the mucosa. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia are common, but fever is rare. The Nikolsky sign, where upper layers of epidermis move laterally with slight pressure or rubbing of skin adjacent to a blister, is negative.

Severity of symptoms correlates to severity of blistering and scarring and ranges from mild to severe. Extensive mucocutaneous epidermolysis bullosa of any type can cause severe pain. Widespread skin lesions cause fluid imbalances and protein wasting. Skin lesions may become infected, and infections can become systemic. Mucous membrane involvement may cause malnutrition and failure to thrive, impaired breathing, and genitourinary problems.         Epidermolysis bullosa simplex    A mild subtype causes local blistering of only the palms and soles. A severe, generalized subtype causes blistering of the trunk, arms, and neck, and the oral mucosa may be involved.  Bullae usually heal without scarring because they lie superficially in the epidermis. Over time, hyperkeratosis develops on the palms and soles, either as focal calluses or as diffuse thickening in severe cases.       Junctional epidermolysis bullosa    A mild subtype affects only the elbows, hands, knees, and feet (typical friction sites) and often abates after infancy. Enamel hypoplasia, nail malformations, and alopecia also occur. Healing does not involve extensive scarring.  A severe, generalized mucocutaneous blistering may involve large areas of skin and also the conjunctiva, mouth, and gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts. Characteristic red, moist skin plaques (healing by granulation tissue formation) around the mouth and central face are pathognomonic.  Severe bullae heal with scarring because they occur in deeper junctional and dermal levels. Scarring of luminal lesions may cause symptomatic strictures. For example, laryngotracheal stenosis can cause stridor or a weak or hoarse cry, which implies internal involvement and a poor prognosis. Scarring of skin lesions can result in joint contractures and pseudosyndactyly.       Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa    Mild and moderate subtypes primarily affect only the elbows, hands, knees, and feet. Nail malformations often occur and may be the sole symptom in mild cases.  A severe subtype manifests with diffuse mucocutaneous blistering at birth. The entire skin surface and the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa may be affected. Often, wide areas of skin are absent, sloughed during birth. Scarring causes a variety of external and internal complications. Pseudosyndactyly occurs nearly always.  Mild bullae heal with nonsevere scarring (worse in the moderate form) and milia. Severe bullae heal with scarring because they occur in deeper levels.        Kindler syndrome    Kindler syndrome has no subtypes. Blistering particularly affects the dorsa of the hands and feet. Repeated episodes lead to progressive skin atrophy (thin, wrinkled skin), which can spread to other areas.  Photosensitivity, which may be mild, distinguishes Kindler syndrome from the other 3 major epidermolysis bullosa types. Poikiloderma (constellation of skin atrophy, pigment changes, and telangiectasias) is common.  Mucocutaneous scarring leads to esophageal and genitourinary stenoses, ectropion, and pseudosyndactyly. Severe Kindler syndrome bullae heal with scarring because they occur in deeper levels.   ",,

All cause abscesses, scar tissue, and fistulas.    Abdominal actinomycosis    Actinomyces bacteria infect the intestine, usually the area near the appendix, and the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). Chronic abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, and severe weight loss are common symptoms.  Fistulas may form from the interior of the abdomen to the skin above it and between the intestine and other organs.      Pelvic actinomycosis    The bacteria spread to the uterus, usually from an IUD that has been in place for years.  Abscesses and scar tissue may form in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and nearby organs such as the bladder and ureters. Fistulas may form between these organs. Symptoms include chronic abdominal or pelvic pain, fever, weight loss, and vaginal bleeding and discharge.      Cervicofacial actinomycosis    Usually, small, hard, sometimes painful swellings develop in the mouth and on the face, neck, or skin below the jaw (called lumpy jaw). These swellings may soften and discharge pus that contains small, round, yellowish granules. The infection may extend to the cheek, tongue, throat, salivary glands, skull, bones of the neck (cervical vertebrae) and face, brain, or the space within the tissues covering the brain (meninges).      Thoracic actinomycosis    This form affects the chest (thorax). People have chronic chest pain and fever. They lose weight and cough, sometimes bringing up sputum. People probably become infected when they inhale into their lungs fluids that contain bacteria. Abscesses may form in the lungs and eventually spread to the membrane between the lungs and chest wall (pleura). There, abscesses cause irritation (pleuritis), and infected fluid collects (called an empyema). Fistulas may form, enabling the infection to spread to the ribs, skin of the chest, and spine. The infection may spread extensively before it causes any symptoms. Symptoms include chest pain, fever, and a productive cough.      Generalized actinomycosis    Rarely, the bacteria are carried in the bloodstream to infect other organs, such as the brain, spine, lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart valves. In women, the reproductive organs may be infected. Symptoms vary depending on which organs are affected. For example, people may have a headache, back pain, or abdominal pain.   ",,

Symptoms of primary coccidioidomycosis, in decreasing order of frequency, include fever, cough, chest pain, chills, sputum production, sore throat, and hemoptysis. Physical signs may be absent or limited to scattered rales with or without areas of dullness to percussion over lung fields. Some patients develop hypersensitivity to the localized respiratory infection, manifested by arthritis, conjunctivitis, erythema nodosum     Erythema Nodosum  Erythema nodosum is a specific form of panniculitis characterized by tender, red or violet, palpable, subcutaneous nodules on the shins and occasionally other locations.

Primary pulmonary lesions sometimes leave nodular coin lesions that must be distinguished from tumors, tuberculosis, and other granulomatous infections. Sometimes residual cavitary lesions develop; they may vary in size over time and often appear thin-walled. A small percentage of these cavities fail to close spontaneously. Hemoptysis or the threat of rupture into the pleural space occasionally necessitates surgery.       Progressive coccidioidomycosis    Nonspecific symptoms develop a few weeks, months, or occasionally years after primary infection; they include low-grade fever, anorexia, weight loss, and weakness. Cutaneous manifestations are due to immunologically induced reactive eruptions, dissemination of the organisms from the lungs, or direct inoculation (primary cutaneous infection). Erythema nodosum is the most frequent reactive eruption associated with coccidioidomycosis. Erythema nodosum is characterized by multiple, self-limited, erythematous, painful, subcutaneous nodules usually on the lower extremities that appear 1 to 3 weeks after the initial respiratory symptoms. A generalized toxic exanthem and erythema multiforme have also been reported.  Extensive pulmonary involvement is uncommon in otherwise healthy people and occurs mainly in those who are immunocompromised. It may cause progressive cyanosis, dyspnea, and mucopurulent or bloody sputum.    Symptoms of extrapulmonary lesions depend on the site. Draining sinus tracts sometimes connect deeper lesions to the skin. Localized extrapulmonary lesions often become chronic and recur frequently, sometimes long after completion of seemingly successful antifungal therapy. Untreated disseminated coccidioidomycosis is usually fatal and, if meningitis is present, is uniformly fatal without prolonged and possibly lifelong treatment. Case fatality rates in patients with advanced HIV infection exceed 70% within 1 month of diagnosis; whether treatment can alter mortality rates is unclear.   ",,

When symptoms do occur, they can begin abruptly or gradually. They include a fever, chills, and drenching sweats. Chest pain, difficulty breathing, and a hacking cough that may or may not bring up sputum may also develop. The lung infection usually progresses slowly, but people sometimes get better without treatment. In some people, infection progresses rapidly. When blastomycosis spreads from the lungs, it can affect many areas of the body, but the most common sites are the following:  Skin Bones Reproductive and urinary tracts (including the prostate gland)  Brain and the tissues that cover it Skin infection begins as very small, raised bumps (papules), which may contain pus. Raised, warty patches then develop, surrounded by tiny, painless collections of pus (abscesses).   Tissues over infected bones may become swollen, warm, and painful. In men, the coiled tube on top of a testis (epididymis) may swell, causing pain, or infection of the prostate gland (prostatitis) may cause discomfort. Fungi can spread to the tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges), causing fungal meningitis. Abscesses     Abscess of the Brain  A brain abscess is a pocket of pus in the brain.

However, the two types of diabetes can have very similar symptoms if the blood glucose is significantly elevated.  The symptoms of high blood glucose levels include   Increased thirst Increased urination Increased hunger When the blood glucose level rises above 160 to 180 mg/dL (8.9 to 10.0 mmol/L), glucose spills into the urine.

The most common presenting symptoms are fluid retention and puffiness, especially periorbitally; tiredness; cold intolerance; mental fogginess.  Various organ systems may be affected with many possible signs and symptoms, including:   Metabolic manifestations: Cold intolerance, modest weight gain (due to fluid retention and decreased metabolism), hypothermia Neurologic manifestations: Forgetfulness, paresthesias of the hands and feet (often due to carpal tunnel syndrome caused by deposition of proteinaceous ground substance in the ligaments around the wrist and ankle); slowing of the relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes Psychiatric manifestations: Personality changes, depression, dull facial expression, dementia or frank psychosis (myxedema madness) Dermatologic manifestations: Facial puffiness; myxedema; sparse, coarse and dry hair; coarse, dry, scaly and thick skin; carotenemia, particularly notable on the palms and soles (caused by deposition of carotene in the lipid-rich epidermal layers); macroglossia due to deposition of proteinaceous ground substance in the tongue Ocular manifestations: Periorbital swelling due to infiltration with the mucopolysaccharides hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, droopy eyelids because of decreased adrenergic drive Gastrointestinal manifestations: Constipation Gynecologic manifestations: Menorrhagia or secondary amenorrhea Cardiovascular manifestations: Slow heart rate (a decrease in both thyroid hormone and adrenergic stimulation causes bradycardia), enlarged heart on examination and imaging (partly because of dilation but chiefly because of pericardial effusion; pericardial effusions develop slowly and only rarely cause hemodynamic distress) Other manifestations: Pleural or abdominal effusions (pleural effusions develop slowly and only rarely cause respiratory or hemodynamic distress), hoarse voice, and slow speech    Symptoms     Geriatrics Essentials: Hypothyroidism  Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency.

In a woman with hypothyroidism, indications of secondary hypothyroidism are a history of amenorrhea rather than menorrhagia and some suggestive differences on physical examination.  Secondary hypothyroidism is characterized by skin and hair that are dry but not very coarse, skin depigmentation, only minimal macroglossia, atrophic breasts, and low blood pressure. Also, the heart is small, and serous pericardial effusions do not occur. Hypoglycemia is common because of concomitant adrenal insufficiency or growth hormone deficiency.     Myxedema coma    Myxedema coma is a life-threatening complication of hypothyroidism, usually occurring in patients with a long history of hypothyroidism. Its characteristics include coma with extreme hypothermia (temperature 24Â° to 32.2Â° C), areflexia, seizures, and respiratory depression with carbon dioxide retention. Severe hypothermia may be missed unless low-reading thermometers are used. Rapid diagnosis based on clinical judgment, history, and physical examination is imperative, because death is likely without rapid treatment. Precipitating factors include illness, infection, trauma, drugs that suppress the central nervous system, and exposure to cold.   ",,

Some present with neurologic symptoms or bone deformities. In > 90%, characteristic skin lesions are apparent at birth or develop during infancy. CafÃ©-au-lait lesions are medium-brown (cafÃ©-au-lait), freckle-like macules, distributed most commonly over the trunk, pelvis, and flexor creases of elbows and knees. Although children who do not have neurofibromatosis may have 2 or 3 cafÃ©-au-lait lesions, children who have NF1 have â‰¥ 6 such macules and often many more. These macules are > 5 mm in affected prepubertal children and > 15 mm in postpubertal patients (see table Diagnosing Neurofibromatosis     Diagnosing Neurofibromatosis          ). Cutaneous neurofibromas, which arise along small peripheral nerves, are common. During late childhood, these flesh-colored cutaneous tumors of various sizes and shapes appear, ranging in number from several to thousands. They are usually asymptomatic.  Plexiform neurofibromas can develop and have a tendency to grow to large sizes, causing irregularly thickened, distorted structures, sometimes with grotesque deformities that can impinge on nerves and other structures. Plexiform neurofibromas can also involve cranial nerves, typically the 5th, 9th, and 10th. Neurologic symptoms vary, depending on location and number of neurofibromas. Larger neurofibromas may press on their nerve of origin and cause distal paresthesia, pain, and sensory loss or weakness, depending on the function of the nerve that is involved. Neurofibromas that form along spinal nerve roots, especially where the nerve roots are contained by bone, can compress the nerve roots and cause radicular pain, weakness, or widespread sensory loss in that nerve distribution. Plexiform neurofibromas that compress cranial nerves cause deficits typical of those nerves.

Subacute bacterial endocarditis    Initially, symptoms of subacute bacterial endocarditis are vague: low-grade fever (< 39Â° C), night sweats, fatigability, malaise, and weight loss. Chills and arthralgias may occur. Symptoms and signs of valvular insufficiency may be a first clue. Initially, â‰¤ 15% of patients have fever or a murmur, but eventually almost all develop both. Physical examination may be normal or include pallor, fever, change in a preexisting murmur or development of a new regurgitant murmur, and tachycardia.

Advanced pellagra can cause a symmetric photosensitive rash, stomatitis, glossitis, diarrhea, and mental aberrations. Symptoms may appear alone or in combination. Skin symptoms include several types of lesions, which are usually bilaterally symmetric. The distribution of lesionsâ€”at pressure points or sun-exposed skinâ€”is more pathognomonic than the form of the lesions. Lesions can develop in a glovelike distribution on the hands (pellagrous glove) or in a boot-shaped distribution on the feet and legs (pellagrous boot).

Gastrointestinal symptoms early in the deficiency include burning in the pharynx and esophagus and abdominal discomfort and distention. Constipation is common. Later, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Diarrhea is often bloody because of bowel hyperemia and ulceration. Central nervous system symptoms include psychosis, encephalopathy (characterized by impaired consciousness), and cognitive decline (dementia). Psychosis is characterized by memory impairment, disorientation, confusion, and confabulation; the predominant symptom may be excitement, depression, mania, delirium, or paranoia.

Systemic symptoms include generalized afternoon fatigue and malaise, anorexia, generalized weakness, and occasionally low-grade fever. Joint symptoms include pain, swelling, and stiffness. Occasionally, the disease begins abruptly, mimicking an acute viral syndrome. The disease progresses most rapidly during the first 6 years, particularly the first year; 80% of patients develop some permanent joint abnormalities within 10 years. The course is unpredictable in individual patients. Joint symptoms are characteristically symmetric. Typically, stiffness lasts > 60 minutes after rising in the morning but may occur after any prolonged inactivity (called gelling). Involved joints become tender, with erythema, warmth, swelling, and limitation of motion. The joints primarily involved include the following:  Wrists and the index (2nd) and middle (3rd) metacarpophalangeal joints (most commonly involved) Proximal interphalangeal joints Metatarsophalangeal joint Shoulders Elbows Hips Knees Ankles However, virtually any joint, except the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, may be involved. Initial manifestations include  Monoarthritis of knee, wrist, shoulder, or ankle Polymyalgia rheumaticaâ€“like presentation predominantly with shoulder and hip girdle involvement, especially in older patients Palindromic rheumatism, characterized by recurrent attacks of joint and tendon sheath pain with swelling Joint swelling without chronic joint damage Robustus rheumatoid arthritis with proliferative synovitis but minimal pain Lower spine involvement is not characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis, but cervical spine inflammation can result in instability, which can become an emergency. Synovial thickening and swelling are often detectable. Joints are often held in flexion to minimize pain, which results from joint capsular distention.

BoutonniÃ¨re and swan-neck deformities                           Extra-articular manifestations    Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules are not usually an early sign but eventually develop in up to 30% of patients, usually at sites of pressure and chronic irritation (eg, the extensor surface of the forearm, metacarpophalangeal joints, soles of feet). Paradoxically, rheumatoid nodules can increase in patients taking methotrexate, despite lessening of joint inflammation. Visceral nodules (eg, pulmonary) are usually asymptomatic and may occur in severe rheumatoid arthritis.

Attacks develop over hours or days and can last up to several weeks. Most gene carriers experience no, or only a few, attacks during their lifetime. Others experience recurrent symptoms. In some women, recurrent attacks often coincide with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.     The acute porphyric attack    The symptoms and signs of attacks are nonspecific and can mimic many other disease processes. Constipation, fatigue, mental status changes (often described as ""fogginess""), and insomnia typically precede an acute attack. The most common symptoms of an attack are   Abdominal pain Vomiting Abdominal pain may be excruciating and is disproportionate to abdominal tenderness or other physical signs. Abdominal manifestations may result from effects on visceral nerves. Usually, there is no inflammation, the abdomen is not tender, and there are no peritoneal signs.

The severity of acute pancreatitis is...  read more        , for which alternative potential causes, such as gallstones, excess alcohol use, and severe hypertriglyceridemia, are not found.  Temperature and white blood cell count are usually normal or only slightly increased. Bowel distention may develop as a result of paralytic ileus. The urine is red or reddish brown and strongly positive for porphobilinogen during an attack. All components of the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system may be involved. Motor neuropathy is common with severe and prolonged attacks. Muscle weakness usually begins in the extremities but can involve any motor neuron or cranial nerve and proceed to tetraplegia. Bulbar involvement can cause respiratory failure. Central nervous system involvement may cause seizures or mental disturbances (eg, apathy, delirium, depression, agitation, frank psychosis, hallucinations). Seizures, psychotic behavior, and hallucinations may be due to or exacerbated by hyponatremia or hypomagnesemia. Hyponatremia may occur during an acute attack due to excessive vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) release and/or administration of hypotonic IV solutions (5% or 10% dextrose in water), a standard therapy for acute attacks. The cause of hypomagnesemia is poorly understood. Some patients develop features of the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), characterized by headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss thought to be due to edema in the posterior occipital and parietal lobes (1     Symptoms and signs references  Acute porphyrias result from deficiency of certain enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, resulting in accumulation of heme precursors that cause intermittent attacks of abdominal pain and...  read more     ). Excess catecholamines generally cause restlessness and tachycardia. Rarely, catecholamine-induced arrhythmias cause sudden death. Labile hypertension with transiently high blood pressure may cause vascular changes progressing to irreversible hypertension if untreated. Chronic kidney disease in acute porphyria is multifactorial; acute hypertension (possibly leading to chronic hypertension) is likely a main precipitating factor. However, genetic factors, especially a genetic variation in the peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2) gene, which encodes a peptide and amino acid transporter that can affect reabsorption of ALA in the proximal tubule, have been found in patients with acute intermittent porphyria who have developed chronic kidney disease. Specifically, carriers of the higher affinity variant (PEPT2*1*1) have been found to have more severe renal dysfunction than carriers of the lower affinity variants.       Subacute and chronic symptoms    Some patients have prolonged symptoms of lesser intensity (eg, obstipation, fatigue, headache, back or thigh pain, paresthesias, tachycardia, dyspnea, insomnia, depression, anxiety or other disturbances of mood, seizures). Chronic symptoms between attacks probably occur in many patients, especially those who have experienced more than one acute attack, with pain the most frequent symptom (2     Symptoms and signs references  Acute porphyrias result from deficiency of certain enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, resulting in accumulation of heme precursors that cause intermittent attacks of abdominal pain and...  read more     ).

Late complications of acute porphyrias    Motor involvement during acute attacks may lead to persistent muscle weakness and muscle atrophy between attacks. Cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, systemic arterial hypertension, and renal impairment become more common after middle age in acute intermittent porphyria and possibly also in variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, especially in patients with previous porphyric attacks (3     Symptoms and signs references  Acute porphyrias result from deficiency of certain enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, resulting in accumulation of heme precursors that cause intermittent attacks of abdominal pain and...  read more     ).

In the early (acute) phase, red, oozing, and crusted areas develop, and sometimes blisters. Itching is often intense.  In the chronic (later) phase, scratching and rubbing create areas that appear dry and thickened (lichenified).     Examples of Atopic Dermatitis             Atopic Dermatitis (Acute)  Atopic dermatitis usually develops in infancy.

Â© Springer Science+Business Media                      In infants, rashes on the face spread to the neck, eyelids, scalp, hands, arms, feet, and legs. Large areas of the body may be affected.  In older children and adults, a rash often occurs (and recurs) in only one or a few spots, especially on the front of the neck, the inner folds of the elbows, and behind the knees. Although the color, intensity, and location of the rash vary, the rash always itches. In older children and adults, intense itching is the main symptom. The itching often leads to uncontrollable scratching, triggering a cycle of itching-scratching-itching that makes the problem worse. Continuous scratching causes the skin to thicken (lichenification).   Itching worsens with dry air, irritation, and emotional stress. Common environmental triggers of symptoms include  Excessive bathing or washing Harsh soaps  Presence of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus on the skin Sweating Rough fabrics and wool    Complications of atopic dermatitis    Scratching and rubbing can also tear the skin, leaving an opening for bacteria to enter and cause infections of the skin, tissues below the skin, and nearby lymph nodes.

Signs range from erythema, scaling, and edema to erosions, crusting, and blistering. Chronic and cumulative ICD is more often pruritic.       Allergic contact dermatitis    ACD is more pruritic than painful. Skin changes range from erythema, scaling, and edema, through vesiculation to severe swelling with bullae. Changes often occur in a pattern, distribution, or combination that suggests a specific exposure, such as linear streaking on an arm or leg (eg, due to brushing against poison ivy) or circumferential erythema (under a wristwatch or waistband). Linear streaks are almost always indicative of an external allergen or irritant.  The site of contact is where the allergen contacted the skin, very often the hands, because they touch so many substances. Although the palms and the palmar sides of the fingers are most exposed, ACD often starts in the web spaces between fingers because the thick stratum corneum prevents or delays allergen penetration on the palms and palmar sides of the fingers (also on the soles). With airborne exposure (eg, perfume aerosols), areas not covered by clothing are predominantly affected. Although ACD is typically limited to the site of contact, it may later spread because of scratching and autoeczematization (id reaction, a dermatitis at sites remote from the site of the initial inflammatory problem or infection). Because of the time needed to recruit and expand T cells in the epidermis, ACD typically takes â‰¥ 1 day after exposure to become noticeable and takes 2 to 3 days to become further aggravated (crescendo reaction). (In contrast, ICD typically decreases in intensity [decrescendo reaction] after 1 or 2 days.)        Pearls & Pitfalls     Lesion shape or pattern (linear streaks are almost always indicative of an external allergen or irritant) can help differentiate contact dermatitis from other forms of dermatitis.

In older children and adults, a rash often occurs (and recurs) in only one or a few spots, especially on the front of the neck, the inner folds of the elbows, and behind the knees. Although the color, intensity, and location of the rash vary, the rash always itches. In older children and adults, intense itching is the main symptom. The itching often leads to uncontrollable scratching, triggering a cycle of itching-scratching-itching that makes the problem worse.

Some warts grow in clusters, but others appear as isolated, single growths.  Most warts are painless, but some hurt when touched. Warts on the feet can cause pain when standing or walking.  Warts may have black dots, particularly if shaved.    Common warts    Common warts (also called verrucae vulgaris), which almost everyone gets, are firm growths that usually have a rough surface.  They are round or irregularly shaped; are light gray, yellow, brown, or gray-black; and are usually less than 1/2 inch (about 1 centimeter) across.  Generally, they appear on areas that are frequently injured, such as the knees, face, fingers, and elbows. Common warts may spread to surrounding skin.        Plantar warts and palmar warts    Plantar warts develop on the sole of the foot, where they are usually flattened by the pressure of walking and are surrounded by thickened skin.    Palmar warts develop on the palm of the hand.    Plantar and palmar warts tend to be hard and flat, with a rough surface and well-defined boundaries. They are often tender, and plantar warts can be very painful when standing or walking, which puts pressure on them.  Warts may appear on the top of the foot or on the toes, where they are usually raised and fleshier.  Warts are often gray or brown and have a small black center.

Mosaic warts    Mosaic warts are clusters of smaller plantar warts that join together. Like other plantar warts, they are often tender.      Periungual warts    Periungual warts are thickened, cauliflower-like growths around the nails. (Warts that grow under the mails are called subungual warts.) The nail may lose its cuticle, and other skin infections (such as paronychia     Acute Paronychia  Acute paronychia is a bacterial infection of the nail fold. In acute paronychia, bacteria (usually Staphylococcus aureus or streptococci) enter through a break in the skin resulting from...  read more        ) can develop around the nail.  These warts are more common among people who bite their nails or have an occupation where their hands are chronically wet such as dishwashing and bartending.      Filiform warts    These warts are long, narrow, branch-like growths that usually appear on the eyelids, face, neck, or lips.  This type of wart usually does not cause symptoms and is usually easy to treat.        Flat warts    Flat warts usually appear in groups as smooth, flat-topped, yellow-brown, pink, or skin-colored spots, most frequently on the face and tops of the hands. They can also develop along scratch marks. The beard area in men and the legs in women are also common locations for flat warts, where they may be spread by shaving.  Flat warts are more common among children and young adults. This type of wart typically causes no symptoms but is usually difficult to treat.

The bumps are usually less than 1/4 inch (about 0.2 to 0.5 centimeters) in diameter, shaped like a dome, and have a tiny dimple in the center. In children, the bumps occur most commonly on the face, trunk, arms, and legs. In adults, the bumps occur most commonly on the penis, vulva, or in the pubic area.  The bumps usually are not itchy or painful and may be discovered only coincidentally during a physical examination. However, the bumps can become very inflamed (resembling a boil) and itchy as the body fights off the virus. This inflammation may indicate that the bumps will soon disappear.

The skin around the blisters is often red.      Oral infection    The first oral infection with HSV usually causes many painful sores inside the mouth (herpetic gingivostomatitis). Herpetic gingivostomatitis most commonly develops in children. Before the sores appear, people may feel a tingling discomfort or itching in the area. In addition, people usually feel sick and have a fever, a headache, and body aches.  The mouth sores last 10 to 19 days and are often very severe, making eating and drinking extremely uncomfortable. As a result, people may become dehydrated. Occasionally, no symptoms develop. Recurrences usually produce a cluster of sores on the rim of the lip. The sores then rupture and crust over. The lip sore is called a cold sore or fever blister (so named because they are often triggered by colds or fevers). Other triggers include sunburn on the lips, anxiety, certain dental procedures, and any condition that reduces the body's resistance to infection.   Before a cold sore appears, people usually feel a tingling at the site, lasting from minutes to a few hours, followed by redness and swelling. Usually, fluid-filled blisters form and break open, leaving sores. The sores quickly form a scab. After about 5 to 10 days, the scab falls off and the episode ends. Less often, tingling and redness occur without blister formation.

Internal blisters are less painful and are not visible. The blisters develop 4 to 7 days after people are infected. The blisters go away but may come back (recur) because the virus never truly leaves the body. Blisters caused by a first genital infection are usually more painful, last longer, and are more widespread than those caused by a recurrent infection. In people with a weakened immune system, recurrences of oral or genital herpes can result in progressive, gradually enlarging sores that take weeks to heal. The infection may progress inside the body, moving into the esophagus, lungs, or colon. Ulcers in the esophagus cause pain during swallowing, and lung infection causes pneumonia with cough and shortness of breath. Sometimes HSV-1 or HSV-2 enters through a break in the skin of a finger, causing a swollen, painful, red fingertip (herpetic whitlow     Herpetic Whitlow  Herpetic whitlow is a viral infection of the fingertip.

Newborns with HSV infection become very ill. They may have widespread disease, brain infection, or skin infection. Without treatment, about 85% of those with widespread disease and about half of those with a brain infection die. Even with treatment, many have brain damage.   ",,

This disease affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing painful sores to appear inside the mouth. The rash typically appears on the hands and feet, and occasionally on the arms, upper legs, buttocks, or genitals and less commonly on the torso and face. Children have a sore throat or mouth pain and may refuse to eat. The sores usually heal quickly.   Depending on which virus causes this disease, children rarely develop central nervous system infections such as aseptic meningitis     Viral Meningitis        or encephalitis     Encephalitis  Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain that occurs when a virus directly infects the brain or when a virus, vaccine, or something else triggers inflammation.

A strain of coxsackievirus that causes atypical forms of hand-foot-and-mouth disease can cause the sores to appear on different parts of the body. The sores vary in size and sometimes are severe.

In women, internal blisters may develop in the vagina or on the cervix. Internal blisters are less painful and are not visible. The blisters develop 4 to 7 days after people are infected. Blisters caused by a first genital infection are usually more painful, last longer, and are more widespread than those caused by a recurrent infection. Fever and a general feeling of illness (malaise) are common, and some people have burning during urination, difficulty urinating, or constipation. Some people have no symptoms.  Recurrences of genital herpes often begin with symptoms (including tingling, discomfort, itching, or aching in the groin) that precede the blisters by several hours to 2 to 3 days. Painful blisters surrounded by a reddish rim appear on the skin or mucous membranes of the genitals. The blisters quickly break open, leaving sores. Blisters may also appear on the thighs or buttocks or around the anus. In women, blisters may develop on the vulva (the area around the opening of the vagina). These blisters are usually obvious and very painful. A typical episode of recurring genital herpes lasts a week. Bacteria sometimes infect genital sores due to HSV infection. Such sores may appear more irritated or have a thick or foul-smelling discharge.

Herpetic gingivostomatitis most commonly develops in children. Before the sores appear, people may feel a tingling discomfort or itching in the area. In addition, people usually feel sick and have a fever, a headache, and body aches.  The mouth sores last 10 to 19 days and are often very severe, making eating and drinking extremely uncomfortable. As a result, people may become dehydrated. Occasionally, no symptoms develop. Recurrences usually produce a cluster of sores on the rim of the lip. The sores then rupture and crust over.

Lesions consist of clusters of pink, dome-shaped, smooth, waxy, or pearly and umbilicated papules, usually 2 to 5 mm in diameter, which occur most commonly on the face, trunk, and extremities in children and on the pubis, penis, or vulva in adults. Lesions may grow to 10 to 15 mm in diameter, especially among patients with HIV infection and other immunodeficiencies.  Lesions are usually not pruritic or painful and may be discovered only coincidentally during a physical examination. However, the lesions can become inflamed and itchy as the body fights off the virus.

Infected people develop fever, headache, and backache and feel extremely ill. They may have severe abdominal pain and become delirious. After 2 or 3 days, a rash of flat, red spots develops in the mouth and on the face. Shortly thereafter, it spreads to the trunk and legs, then the hands and feet. People are contagious only after the rash has started and are most contagious for the first 7 to 10 days after the rash appears. After 1 or 2 days, the spots turn into blisters, which fill with pus (forming pustules). After 8 or 9 days, the pustules become crusted. The lungs, brain, and/or bone may become infected. About 30% of people with smallpox die, usually in the second week of the disease. Some of the survivors are left with large, disfiguring scars.   In a few people with the severe form, the initial symptoms develop more quickly and are more intense. One rare type, called hemorrhagic smallpox, causes bleeding. After a few days, bleeding occurs in the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. Almost all people with hemorrhagic smallpox die in 5 or 6 days.      Variola minor    In the less severe form, symptoms are similar but much less severe. The rash is much less extensive, and fewer than 1% of people die.   ",,

In adults and immunocompromised children, infection can often be serious. Mild headache, moderate fever, and malaise may occur 7 to 21 days after exposure, about 24 to 36 hours before lesions appear. This prodrome is more likely in patients > 10 years and is usually more severe in adults.     Initial rash    The initial rash, a macular eruption, may be accompanied by an evanescent flush. Within a few hours, lesions progress to papules and then characteristic, sometimes pathognomonic teardrop vesicles, often intensely itchy, on red bases. The lesions become pustular and then crust.     Lesions evolve from macules to papules and vesicles, which then crust. A hallmark of chickenpox is that lesions develop in crops so that they are in various stages of development in any affected region. The eruption may be generalized (in severe cases) involving the trunk, extremities, and face, or more limited but almost always involves the upper trunk. Ulcerated lesions may develop on the mucous membranes, including the oropharynx and upper respiratory tract, palpebral conjunctiva, and rectal and vaginal mucosa. In the mouth, vesicles rupture immediately, are indistinguishable from those of herpetic gingivostomatitis, and often cause pain during swallowing. Scalp lesions may result in tender, enlarged suboccipital and posterior cervical lymph nodes. New lesions usually cease to appear by the 5th day, and the majority are crusted by the 6th day; most crusts disappear < 20 days after onset.       Breakthrough varicella    Sometimes vaccinated children develop varicella (called breakthrough varicella); in these cases, the rash is typically milder, fever is less common, and the illness is shorter; the lesions are contagious.       Complications    Secondary bacterial infection (typically streptococcal or staphylococcal) of the vesicles may occur, causing cellulitis or rarely necrotizing fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock.  Pneumonia may complicate severe chickenpox in adults, neonates, and immunocompromised patients of all ages but usually not in immunocompetent young children. Myocarditis, hepatitis, and hemorrhagic complications may also occur. Acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia is one of the most common neurologic complications; it occurs in 1/4000 cases in children.

They are usually asymptomatic but sometimes cause mild pain when they are located on a weight-bearing surface (eg, bottom of the feet).  Common warts are sharply demarcated, rough, round or irregular, firm, and light gray, yellow, brown, or gray-black nodules 2 to 10 mm in diameter. They appear most often on sites subject to trauma (eg, fingers, elbows, knees, face) but may spread elsewhere.

Some warts grow in clusters, but others appear as isolated, single growths.  Most warts are painless, but some hurt when touched. Warts on the feet can cause pain when standing or walking.  Warts may have black dots, particularly if shaved.    Common warts    Common warts (also called verrucae vulgaris), which almost everyone gets, are firm growths that usually have a rough surface.  They are round or irregularly shaped; are light gray, yellow, brown, or gray-black; and are usually less than 1/2 inch (about 1 centimeter) across.  Generally, they appear on areas that are frequently injured, such as the knees, face, fingers, and elbows. Common warts may spread to surrounding skin.        Plantar warts and palmar warts    Plantar warts develop on the sole of the foot, where they are usually flattened by the pressure of walking and are surrounded by thickened skin.    Palmar warts develop on the palm of the hand.    Plantar and palmar warts tend to be hard and flat, with a rough surface and well-defined boundaries. They are often tender, and plantar warts can be very painful when standing or walking, which puts pressure on them.  Warts may appear on the top of the foot or on the toes, where they are usually raised and fleshier.  Warts are often gray or brown and have a small black center.

Mosaic warts    Mosaic warts are clusters of smaller plantar warts that join together. Like other plantar warts, they are often tender.      Periungual warts    Periungual warts are thickened, cauliflower-like growths around the nails. (Warts that grow under the mails are called subungual warts.) The nail may lose its cuticle, and other skin infections (such as paronychia     Acute Paronychia  Acute paronychia is a bacterial infection of the nail fold.

These warts are more common among people who bite their nails or have an occupation where their hands are chronically wet such as dishwashing and bartending.      Filiform warts    These warts are long, narrow, branch-like growths that usually appear on the eyelids, face, neck, or lips.  This type of wart usually does not cause symptoms and is usually easy to treat.        Flat warts    Flat warts usually appear in groups as smooth, flat-topped, yellow-brown, pink, or skin-colored spots, most frequently on the face and tops of the hands. They can also develop along scratch marks. The beard area in men and the legs in women are also common locations for flat warts, where they may be spread by shaving.  Flat warts are more common among children and young adults. This type of wart typically causes no symptoms but is usually difficult to treat.        Genital warts    Also called venereal warts or condylomata acuminata, genital warts     Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection  Human papillomavirus (HPV) can be sexually transmitted and causes changes in cells, which can lead to genital warts or to precancer or cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, or throat.

The most common types are  Nodular (about 60% of basal cell carcinomas): These types are small, shiny, firm, almost translucent to pink nodules with telangiectases, usually on the face. Ulceration and crusting are common. Superficial (about 30%): These types are red or pink, marginated, thin papules or plaques, commonly on the trunk, that are difficult to differentiate from psoriasis or localized dermatitis. Morpheaform (5 to 10%): These types are flat, scarlike, indurated plaques that can be flesh-colored or light red and have vague borders. Other: Other types are possible. Nodular and superficial basal cell carcinomas can produce pigment (sometimes called pigmented basal cell carcinomas).

Patients may report recurrent sinusitis that has responded inadequately to multiple antibiotic regimens and has required one or more sinus operations before diagnosis. Secondary infections (eg, due to Staphylococcus aureus) may develop. Subglottic stenosis may develop, causing symptoms such as pain in the larynx, hoarseness, dyspnea, wheezing, and stridor. Ears: Otitis, sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and chondritis may occur. The middle ear, inner ear, and mastoids are often affected. Eyes: Eyes may appear red and swollen. Nasolacrimal duct inflammation and obstruction, conjunctivitis, scleritis, uveitis, or retinal vasculitis may also occur. Inflammatory infiltrates in the retro-orbital space (orbital pseudotumor) can cause proptosis, compression of the optic nerve, and blindness. Extension into the extraocular muscles leads to diplopia. If serious eye symptoms develop, evaluation and treatment are required immediately to prevent permanent vision loss. Lower respiratory tract: Respiratory manifestations are common. Inflammation of the major bronchi and branches can cause localized wheezing, postobstructive pneumonia, and atelectasis. Single or multiple pulmonary nodules, with or without cavitation, and parenchymal infiltrates, sometimes cause symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and productive cough. Dyspnea with bilateral infiltrates, with or without hemoptysis, may indicate alveolar hemorrhage and must be evaluated immediately. Heart: Coronary artery disease may occur but rarely. Musculoskeletal system: Patients frequently present with myalgias, arthralgias, or nonerosive inflammatory arthritis. Skin: Palpable purpura, tender subcutaneous nodules, papules, livedo reticularis, or ulcers may develop. Nervous system: Vasculitis may cause ischemic peripheral neuropathy, brain lesions, or extension of inflammation into neural tissue from contiguous sites. Lesions that originate in the sinuses or middle ear may extend directly to the retropharyngeal area and base of the skull, leading to cranial neuropathy, proptosis, diabetes insipidus, or meningitis. Kidneys: Symptoms and signs of glomerulonephritis develop. Urinary sediment is frequently abnormal, and serum creatinine may increase rapidly. Edema and hypertension may result.

The lesion, which may resemble a furuncle or an arthropod bite at this stage, ulcerates and expands rapidly, developing a swollen necrotic base and a raised dusky to violaceous border. An undermined border (ie, loss of underlying support tissue at the border) is common, if not pathognomonic. Systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise are common. The ulcers can coalesce to form larger ulcers, often with cribriform or sieve-like scarring.  Symptoms and signs can vary with the subtype.     Ulcerative (classic) subtype    In this most common subtype, ulcers form as described above, most commonly on the lower extremities or trunk, particularly the buttocks and perineum.         Bullous (atypical) subtype    This less common subtype often develops in patients with hematologic disorders. Lesions usually begin as bullae that erode, becoming superficial ulcers. The arms and face are most often involved.         Pustular subtype    This subtype tends to develop during exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease. Painful pustules develop, surrounded by erythema. Arthralgias are common.       Vegetative (superficial granulomatous pyoderma) subtype    In this subtype, a single, indolent, mildly painful plaque or superficial ulcer develops, most often on the head or neck. The border is not undermined and the base is not necrotic.         Other subtypes    Pyoderma gangrenosum can also develop at other sites, such as around a stoma in patients who have inflammatory bowel disease (peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum), on the genitals (genital pyoderma gangrenosum), or in sites other than the skin, such as the bones, cornea, central nervous system, heart, intestine, liver, lungs, or muscle (extracutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum).

Polyarthralgia is also prominent. Gastrointestinal disturbances (eg, heartburn, dysphagia) or respiratory complaints (eg, dyspnea) are occasionally the first manifestations.     Skin and nail manifestations    Swelling of the skin is usually symmetric and progresses to induration. It may be confined to the fingers (sclerodactyly) and hands, or it may affect most or all of the body. The skin eventually becomes taut, shiny, and hypopigmented or hyperpigmented; the face becomes masklike; and telangiectases may appear on the fingers, chest, face, lips, and tongue. However, in some patients, skin can soften to variable degrees. Subcutaneous calcifications may develop, usually on the fingertips (pulps) and over bony eminences. Digital ulcers are common, especially on the fingertips, overlying the finger joints, or over calcinotic nodules.

If caused by a drug, these symptoms usually appear 1 to 3 weeks after the start of the drug. Then the skin changes begin, with a flat red rash on the face, neck, and trunk, often spreading later to the rest of the body in an irregular pattern. The areas of rash enlarge and spread, often forming blisters in their center. The skin of the blisters is very loose and easy to rub off, often with just a gentle touch or pull, and the blisters peel off over a period of 1 to 3 days. The affected areas are painful, and the person feels very ill with chills and fever. In some people, the hair and nails fall out. The palms and soles may be affected. In both disorders, sores appear on the mucous membranes lining the mouth, throat, anus, genitals, and eyes. The damage to the lining of the mouth makes eating difficult, and closing the mouth may be painful, so the person may drool. The eyes may become very painful and swell and become so crusted that they seal shut. The corneas can become scarred. The opening through which urine passes (urethra) may also be affected, making urination difficult and painful. Sometimes the mucous membranes of the digestive and respiratory tracts are involved, resulting in diarrhea and cough, pneumonia, and difficulty breathing.   The extensive skin loss in toxic epidermal necrolysis is similar to a severe burn and is equally life threatening. People are very ill and may be unable to eat or open their eyes. Huge amounts of fluids and salts can seep from the large, raw, damaged areas. People who have this disorder are very susceptible to organ failure. They are also at risk of infection at the sites of damaged, exposed tissues. Such infections are the most common cause of death in people with this disorder. ",,

Grows rapidly
Ruptures or becomes painful or infected
Occurs in a spot that's constantly irritated
Bothers you for cosmetic reasons
Is in an unusual location, such as a finger and toe
The surface of your skin (epidermis) is made up of a thin, protective layer of cells that your body continuously sheds. Most epidermoid cysts form when these cells move deeper into your skin and multiply rather than slough off. Sometimes the cysts form due to irritation or injury of the skin or the most superficial portion of a hair follicle.The epidermal cells form the walls of the cyst and then secrete the protein keratin into the interior. The keratin is the thick, yellow substance that sometimes drains from the cyst. This abnormal growth of cells may be due to a damaged hair follicle or oil gland in your skin.Many people refer to epidermoid cysts as sebaceous cysts, but they're different. True sebaceous cysts are less common. They arise from the glands that secrete oily matter that lubricates hair and skin (sebaceous glands).Nearly anyone can develop one or more epidermoid cysts, but these factors make you more susceptible:
Being past puberty
Having certain rare genetic disorders
Injuring the skin
Potential complications of epidermoid cysts include:
Inflammation. An epidermoid cyst can become tender and swollen, even if it's not infected. An inflamed cyst is difficult to remove. Your doctor is likely to postpone removing it until the inflammation subsides.
Rupture. A ruptured cyst often leads to a boil-like infection that requires prompt treatment.
Infection. Cysts can become infected and painful (abscessed).

For example, a woman who has keloid-prone skin can develop a keloid on her belly after having a cesarean section (C-section), hysterectomy, or other surgery in this area.Navel piercing can also cause a keloid on the belly.Men who have darkly pigmented skin and shave their beard area may develop keloids on their face.Itâ€™s rare for a keloid to develop on the genitals, palms, soles, or tongue.Youâ€™ll likely notice one or more of the following, as this scar forms:After you injure skin, itâ€™s likely to take 3 to 12 months or longer to see the first signs of a keloid. The first sign is usually thickening skin. About 20% of keloid scars appear more than a year after the injury.When it began, the keloid on this girlâ€™s earlobe looked like a pimple. It continued to grow. Most keloids continue to grow for weeks or months after they appear. A few grow for years. Growth tends to be slow. Occasionally, a keloid grows quickly.While a keloid is growing, it may feel tender or painful. It may itch or cause a burning sensation. Symptoms tend to end when the keloid stops growing, but not always. This man developed keloids on his face after chickenpox cleared. Decades later, the keloids still itch and feel painful.The color of a keloid, like the one on this patientâ€™s shoulder, can differ from that of your natural skin color. When a keloid first appears, itâ€™s often red, pink, or slightly darker than your natural skin tone. As it grows, it may darken. Some become lighter in the center and darker at the edges.Some people say their keloid darkens noticeably after they spent time in the sun. This darkening can be permanent.Once a keloid stops growing, it tends to remain the same size. Unlike other scars, a keloid rarely fades without treatment.The keloid you see on your skin can look different from the keloid you see on someone elseâ€™s skin. Sometimes, one keloid on your skin will look very different from another. The following pictures of keloids show how different keloids can look. Most keloids are either round, oval, or oblong. On the chest, arms, or legs, this scar is usually raised and has a flat surface. A keloid on the ear, neck, or belly may hang from the skin.A keloid can range from the size of a pimple to larger than a football.When you touch a keloid, youâ€™re most likely to feel one of these textures. A few keloids have a texture thatâ€™s somewhere in between hard and soft.Most people develop one or two keloids. Some people get several. Youâ€™re more likely to develop many keloids after acne or chickenpox clears, but not always. The girl in this picture developed two keloids after chickenpox cleared.While most keloids are harmless, they can interfere with your life. A keloid can: When a keloid covers a large area or develops over a joint, the hardened, tight scar tissue often limits how far you can move. If this happens, it may affect your ability to reach, walk, and do other activities.A keloid rarely opens upon its own. Like the rest of your skin, you may see a keloid bleeding if you injure it. An open keloid can become infected. If the wound on a keloid fails to heal, see a dermatologist.Having a keloid can be hard on your self-esteem. These scars can be noticeable. Most people who seek treatment for a keloid do so because they dislike what it looks like.When people see a dermatologist for treatment, they often ask what caused them to get this scar.

The most visible signs of KS are lesions on your skin: flat, painless spots that are red or purple on light skin and bluish, brownish, or black on dark skin. Unlike bruises, they don't change color when you press on them. They aren't itchy, and they don't drain. They're not dangerous.

New spots may show up each week. For some people, these lesions change slowly. They may grow into raised bumps or merge together.

Kaposi’s Sarcoma Ecchymotic. Kaposi’s Sarcoma Ecchymotic is a type of Kaposi’s sarcoma in which blood vessels from the KS tumors leak blood into the surrounding areas.  The tumors from KS have tiny blood vessels which grow beneath the skin and often can be mistaken as bruises or other wounds.

0,Eczema,Dyshidrosis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dyshidrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352342,"Dyshidrosis symptoms include painful, itchy and fluid-filled blisters on the sides of the fingers, the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet. The blisters are small â€” about the width of a standard pencil lead. They are grouped in clusters and can look like tapioca.With severe disease, the small blisters can merge to form larger blisters. Skin affected by dyshidrosis can be painful and very itchy. After a few weeks, the blisters dry and flake off.Dyshidrosis tends to come back regularly for months or years.Call your doctor if you have a rash on your hands or feet that's severe, doesn't go away, or spreads beyond the hands and feet.The cause of dyshidrosis isn't known. It tends to happen in people who have a skin condition called atopic dermatitis (eczema) and allergic conditions, such as hay fever or glove allergy. Dyshidrosis isn't contagious.Risk factors for dyshidrosis include:
Stress. Dyshidrosis appears to be more common during times of emotional or physical stress.
Exposure to certain metals. These include cobalt and nickel â€” often in an industrial setting.
Sensitive skin. People who develop a rash after contact with certain irritants are more likely to form the blisters of dyshidrosis.
Atopic dermatitis. Some people with atopic dermatitis may have dyshidrosis.
For most people with dyshidrosis, it's just an itchy inconvenience. For others, the pain and itching may limit the use of their hands or feet. Intense scratching can increase the risk of a bacterial infection of the affected skin.After healing, you may notice skin color changes in the affected area. This is called postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. It's more likely to occur in people with brown or Black skin. This complication most often goes away in time without treatment.There's no way to prevent dyshidrosis. It may help to manage stress and avoid exposure to metal salts, such as cobalt and nickel.Good skin care practices may help protect the skin as well. These include:
Using mild, nonsoap cleansers and lukewarm water to wash your hands.
Drying your hands well.
Applying moisturizer at least twice a day.
Wearing gloves. But if you notice that wearing gloves worsens the rash, you may be sensitive to gloves. Let your doctor know about this. Try cotton gloves to prevent irritation. For wet activities, you might try wearing cotton gloves under waterproof gloves.",,,
0,Eczema,Nummular,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/nummular-dermatitis/symptoms,"This type of eczema usually develops on the legs, forearms, or backs of the hands â€” and often on both sides. If you have nummular eczema, here are the signs and symptoms that can develop. The following pictures show what you may see on your skin.The is often the first sign. The tiny bumps and blister-like sores may appear after you injure your skin. For example, a scrape on the back of one knee could trigger nummular eczema bumps on the backs of both knees.The tiny bumps will crust over and join together. This causes the coin-shaped spots that this type of eczema was named for. Nummular means resembling a coin, and these round to oval-shaped spots can look like imperfectly shaped coins.If you have a darker skin tone, you may see brown spots. The spots can also appear lighter than your natural skin color. On lighter skin tones, the spots are pink or red. Regardless of color, these raised (and often scaly) spots can last for weeks or months.The spots can be intensely itchy. This itch tends to worsen when you relax or try to sleep. Some people say the skin with nummular eczema burns or stings. The skin between the spots is often extremely dry. Scratching the intensely itchy spots can cause raw, open skin. If germs from your hands spread to the open and raw skin, you may develop an infection. Signs of an infection include yellow or golden crusts on the spots of nummular eczema.An infection can start on skin with or without nummular eczema. Look for yellow or golden crusts, streaks of red (light skin) or brown (dark skin), swelling, or pus. Infected areas may feel tender or painful.As the spots start to clear, they flatten out. The center of the spot may clear first, as shown here.After a spot clears, you may see a flat spot of discolored skin. The flat spot that appears when nummular eczema clears is a skin reaction. Itâ€™s not nummular eczema. Most people who develop skin discoloration have darker skin tones.Some people continue to get nummular eczema. When this happens, new spots may appear as older ones clear or time may pass before the next flare-up. If flare-ups continue, you tend to see large, raised patches instead of coin-shaped spots.Why some people continue to develop nummular eczema isnâ€™t entirely clear. Researchers have learned that some people have a higher risk of developing this type of eczema. To find out if youâ€™re at risk, go to: Nummular eczema: Causes.Images

Most people develop it only on their hands. Whether it appears on your hands, feet, or both, dyshidrotic eczema can cause these signs and symptoms.Before you see anything on your skin, you may have intense itching, burning, or pain on the skin where blisters will appear. Some people say their skin feels prickly.The tiny blisters develop in one or more of these areas â€” palms, the sides of your fingers, or feet. Where you have blisters, your skin may feel intensely itchy or painful.Some people develop groups of blisters that grow together, forming larger blisters.For some people, the skin with blisters tends to be wet with sweat.The blisters clear in about 3 to 4 weeks. As the blisters clear, youâ€™ll see peeling skin where you had blisters, and the skin will feel dry.People who have a darker skin tone may develop lingering dark spots where they had blisters.Scratching the intensely itchy blisters can lead to a skin infection. This may happen when scratching opens up the blisters and germs get inside. Signs of a skin infection include swelling, redness, and yellow crusting where you have blisters.If you have signs of an infection, get medical care. Some people develop a potentially serious infection called cellulitis, which develops deep in the skin.  How often someone gets dyshidrotic eczema varies. Some people have a single flare-up and never develop it again. Itâ€™s more common to have flare-ups that come and go. New blisters can appear once a month, once a year, or somewhere in between.Whether you get new blisters monthly, yearly, or somewhere in between, repeated flare-ups can cause changes to your skin and nails. These changes include:When this happens, the skin can become inflamed, as shown here. Sometimes, the skin between your fingers or toes develops a soft, spongy texture.The skin may feel scaly and have deep, painful cracks.People who have long-standing dyshidrotic eczema can develop the nail changes shown here. The nails can develop pits and ridges, grow thick, and show discoloration.When you have blisters on your feet, wearing shoes can feel painful. Some people who get blisters on their feet say itâ€™s too painful to walk until the blisters clear. Flare-ups that lead to blisters on the hands can cause other problems. During flare-ups, the pain can limit what you can do with your hands. An auto mechanic or florist may be unable to perform certain jobs.

0,Eczema,Prurigo Nodularis,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/prurigo-nodularis-symptoms,"Prurigo nodularis causes itchy bumps on the skin, which appear when someone repeatedly scratches, picks at, or rubs their skin. These itchy bumps, which dermatologists call ""nodules,"" can develop anywhere on skin that you can scratch, pick, or rub. While the itchy bumps can develop anywhere, most appear on one or more of these areas:ArmsLegsUpper backLower backButtocksAbdomenThe following describes what you may experience if you have prurigo nodularis.Before the itchy bumps of prurigo nodularis appear, the skin often itches. This itch can be long-lasting or come in short bursts. Either way, it's often intense. Some people have a few itchy areas. For others, the itch covers much of their skin.Instead of feeling itchy, some people say that their skin burns or stings. While rare, patients have said they experience other sensations, like the feeling that bugs are crawling on their skin.The repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing leads to itchy bumps. The itchy bumps usually appear about six weeks after your skin starts to itch, burn, or sting. Often, the bumps develop evenly on both sides of the body.The bumps can be the color of your skin, pink, red, or brownish black.

Purple, shiny, flat bumps, often on the inner forearms, wrists or ankles.
Lines of rash where the skin has been scratched.
Lacy white patches on the tongue or inside of the cheeks.
Itchiness.
Painful sores in the mouth or genitals.
Rarely, hair loss.
Nail scarring or loss.
Dark lines from the tip of the nail to the base.
See your health care provider if tiny bumps or a rash appears on your skin for no known reason, such as contact with poison ivy. Also see your health care provider if you have any symptoms related to lichen planus of the mouth, genitals, scalp or nails.It's best to get a prompt and correct diagnosis because a number of skin and mucous membrane conditions can cause sores and pain.The cause of lichen planus is likely related to the immune system attacking cells of the skin or mucous membranes. It's not clear why this irregular immune response happens. The condition isn't contagious.Lichen planus may be activated by:
Hepatitis C infection.
Pain relievers and other medicines.
An allergic reaction to the metal in dental fillings.
Anyone can develop lichen planus. It most often affects middle-aged adults. Lichen planus in the mouth is more likely to affect women than men.Lichen planus can be difficult to treat on the vulva and in the vagina. It can cause scarring and severe pain. Sores on the genitals can make sex painful.The affected skin and nails might stay slightly darker even after healing.Oral sores may affect your ability to eat.

Some people develop a few large patches on their skin. Itâ€™s also possible to see only bumps. Although signs and symptoms can vary, the following explains what generally happens when someone gets pityriasis rosea.Before you see signs on your skin: Many people remember feeling sick for a day or two before a large patch or rash appears on their skin. Before seeing any signs on your skin, you may develop a sore throat or flu-like symptoms.
A sore throat is the most common symptom. The lymph nodes in your neck may also feel swollen. Other symptoms that can develop include: FatigueHeadacheFeverLoss of appetiteAchinessNauseaTrouble sleepingLarge patch develops on the skin: As the flu-like symptoms clear, the first sign of pityriasis rosea appears on the skin. This is usually a single patch, which grows larger. Most people develop one large patch on their skin, but itâ€™s possible to develop 2 or more large patches before the rash erupts.The large patch usually develops on the back, chest, or abdomen; however, it can develop anywhere on the skin, including the armpit.If you have light-colored skin, this patch tends to be oval, slightly raised, and pink to salmon in color. The center is often covered with fine white scale. If you have darkly pigmented skin, this oval patch tends to look dusky violet to deep brown in color. The patch can appear anywhere on the skin, but it often develops on the belly, chest, or back. No matter where it appears, it tends to grow, usually for about 2 weeks, before more patchers or spots appear.As a large patch tends to be the first sign of pityriasis rosea, this patch is often given one of the following names:Herald patchMother patchMedallion lesionSmaller patches or bumps: In about 2 weeks, smaller patches or tiny bumps often appear. People who have light-colored skin usually develop patches that look like smaller versions of the herald patch. If you have darkly pigmented skin, small, raised bumps tend to appear.The rash can also look like another skin condition, such as hives, nummular eczema, or psoriasis. People with light-colored skin tend to have a large patch and smaller patches. If you have darkly pigmented skin, the patch tends to be purple to brown in color and the rash usually appears as small bumps on the skin. Most people develop the rash on their torso, and itâ€™s usually densest on their belly. While common on the chest, back, and belly, the rash can appear anywhere on your skin. It can also cover you from head to toe, although this is rare. For about 10-14 days, the rash gradually spreads out, and you see new spots or bumps on your skin. Rash remains the same: Once the rash stops spreading, it lasts for a few days to a few months. The pityriasis rosea rash can look like hives or another skin condition.The skin clears: Some people see the rash go away within 6 to 8 weeks, but it can take 5 months or longer for the skin to clear.No matter how long it takes to clear or what it looks like, thereâ€™s likely only one cause.

This rash can develop on any area of the body except the palms and soles.In adults, this rash often appears on one or more oily areas of the body like the:ScalpForeheadEyebrows (between and underneath)EyelidsEars (behind and inside)Nose (sides)Mouth (around) and beard areaBack of the head and neckChestIf you have extensive seborrheic dermatitis, the scaly rash can also develop on your armpits, belly button, groin, buttocks, or under the breasts. Occasionally, seborrheic dermatitis is so extensive that it covers much of the body.When babies get seborrheic dermatitis, itâ€™s called cradle cap and is usually found on one or more of these areas:Scalp (most common)Skin foldsDiaper area (less common)What you see on your skin tends to vary with your age, skin tone, and whether you have another medical condition like Parkinsonâ€™s disease or HIV/AIDS.Common signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis and cradle cap (seborrheic dermatitis in babies) include the following:This can develop on any part of your body that has seborrheic dermatitis, including the scalp, face, or chest. The flakes are more noticeable where you have a rash or hair, as shown here.This rash can be dry, have greasy scales, or both. If you have a darker skin tone, the rash tends to look pink (A), slightly purple, or lighter than your natural skin tone. Some people with darker skin tones develop white spots on their scalp. In lighter skin tones, the rash is usually red and raised (B).On darker skin tones, youâ€™ll likely see a rash thatâ€™s darker than your natural skin tone (A) or light spots (B). In lighter skin tones, the rash is often red. The skin tends to be oily in some areas and dry in others. Some people develop thin, scaly plaques (raised patches) on their face.The itch is usually mild, but it can be intense, especially on the scalp. With effective treatment for seborrheic dermatitis, the itch and burning go away.Your eyelids contain oil glands. When these oil glands become inflamed, itâ€™s called blepharitis. The skin on the eyelids can become scaly, swollen, discolored, irritated, and itchy. Some people develop yellowish scale between their eyelashes. While blepharitis can feel uncomfortable, it rarely damages the eyes.Seborrheic dermatitis can cause inflammation around or inside the ear. You may see flakes, crusting, cracks in the skin, or oozing from the ear.If skin stays wet for a long time, it starts to break down. The medical name for this is maceration, which is more common in areas like the armpits, belly button, or beneath the breasts. Maceration causes pain, tenderness, and sometimes itchiness or a burning sensation. Left untreated, the skin may start to split or become infected.While the rash can be irritating, most people who develop seborrheic dermatitis feel well unless they have another condition like HIV/AIDS or Parkinsonâ€™s disease.Like adults, what you see on a childâ€™s body differs with skin tone and severity.If your baby has a light skin tone, cradle cap often begins with scaly, greasy patches on the top of the head, which later become a thick, crusty mass that covers the entire scalp and sometimes the parts of the face.Babies with darker skin tones have discoloration, flakes, and areas of lighter or white skin on their scalp.Occasionally, cradle cap develops on a babyâ€™s entire body or the diaper area where it is often mistaken for diaper rash. In babies who have a lighter skin tone, the scales can be dry or greasy and the rash red. Babies who have darker skin tones may have white spots, flaky skin, and a rash that is either darker than their natural skin tone or purplish.Many parents of a child with cradle cap and patients with seborrheic dermatitis want to know why they have this condition.

Skin peeling as the rash fades
One to 2 days after the illness begins, a red rash usually appears. However, the rash can appear before illness or up to 7 days later.

The rash may first appear on the neck, underarm, and groin (the area where your stomach meets your thighs). Over time, the rash spreads over the body. The rash usually begins as small, flat blotches that slowly become fine bumps that feel like sandpaper.

Although the cheeks might look flushed (rosy), there may be a pale area around the mouth. Underarm, elbow, and groin skin creases may become brighter red than the rest of the rash.

The rash from scarlet fever fades in about 7 days. As the rash fades, the skin may peel around the fingertips, toes, and groin area. This peeling can last up to several weeks.",,,

Small, itchy areas on your skin, often on your feet or hands.
Sores or blistering.
Swelling.
Pain or stinging.
Changes in skin color.
Seek medical care for chilblains if you:
Have symptoms that are long lasting or go away then flare.
Think you might have an infection.
Have symptoms that aren't improving after two weeks of home care.
Have symptoms that extend into the warm season.
Aren't sure whether you were in below-freezing temperatures, as you might have frostbite.
The exact cause of chilblains is unknown. They may be an unusual reaction of your body to cold followed by rewarming. Rewarming of cold skin can cause small blood vessels under the skin to expand more quickly than nearby larger blood vessels can handle.The following factors increase the risk of chilblains:
Wearing clothing and shoes that are tight or expose skin to the cold. Wearing tightfitting clothing and shoes in cold, damp weather may make you more susceptible to chilblains.
Being a young woman. This condition is most common in females between the ages of 15 and 30.
Being underweight. This condition is most common in people with a low body mass.
Living in cold, humid areas. Your risk of chilblains is higher if you live in an area with high humidity and cold but not freezing temperatures.
Having certain medical conditions. These include Raynaud's phenomenon, connective tissue disease and SARS-CoV-2.
Chilblains symptoms that are long-lasting and develop after repeated exposure to cold and damp conditions can cause scarring and thin skin.To prevent chilblains:
Avoid or limit your exposure to the cold.
When you come in from the cold, rewarm the skin gradually.
Dress in layers of loose clothing and wear mittens, a scarf and a hat, and warm, water-resistant footwear.
Cover all exposed skin as completely as possible when going outside in cold weather.

Vitiligo can start at any age, but usually appears before age 30.Depending on the type of vitiligo you have, it may affect:
Nearly all skin surfaces. With this type, called universal vitiligo, the discoloration affects nearly all skin surfaces.
Many parts of the body. With this most common type, called generalized vitiligo, the discolored patches often progress similarly on corresponding body parts (symmetrically).

0,Pigmentation Disorders,Albinism,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184,"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:
Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).
Sunburn and no ability to tan.
For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:
Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.
An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.
Legal blindness â€” vision less than 20/200 â€” or complete blindness.
At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision.If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider.Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes.Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.Types of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected.
Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene â€” one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. OCA is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from OCA1 to OCA8. OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.
Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than OCA.
Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes can occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.
Albinism can include skin and eye complications. It also can include social and emotional challenges.Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive.People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced.Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition.People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress.Using the term ""person with albinism"" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. The counselor can explain the available genetic tests.",,,

The color varies with a personâ€™s skin tone and the severity of the melasma. In general, melasma is slightly darker than your natural skin color. Most people see various shades of brown. Melasma can look bluish gray in people with darker skin tones.The following pictures show what melasma can look like. This woman has melasma on her cheek, chin, above her upper lip, and next to her ear.If you have melasma on your cheeks, youâ€™ll see patches or spots on both cheeks, as shown here. This woman also has melasma on her nose, chin, and above her upper lip.The unevenly shaped patches of melasma can join together, creating one or more large areas of melasma.This womanâ€™s melasma is most noticeable along her jawline. When melasma appears along the jawline, it may be a sign that the skin has been badly damaged by the sunâ€™s rays.You may see patches like those shown here on the sides of this womanâ€™s face, chin, and above her eyes.The light brown patch in the center of this personâ€™s forehead is melasma.While less common, melasma can develop on the arms, as shown here. Regardless of where melasma appears on your skin, it tends to become more noticeable when you spend time in the sun. Protecting your skin from the sun can help fade dark patches and spots.While melasma primarily affects women, some men develop melasma. This man has melasma in common places like his cheeks, chin, forehead, and above his upper lip.While this skin condition can be noticeable, you wonâ€™t feel anything on your skin. Melasma wonâ€™t make your skin itch or cause pain.While your skin doesnâ€™t feel different, melasma can take a toll on your emotions. Having melasma makes some people feel self-conscious. Studies show melasma can lower self-esteem because it affects your appearance.If you dislike the way melasma looks, treatment can help. Any treatment plan for melasma will include sun protection. Thatâ€™s because the sunâ€™s rays play a role in causing melasma.To see what else may play a role in causing these patches and spots, go to Melasma: Causes.Images

Nearly all skin surfaces. With this type, called universal vitiligo, the discoloration affects nearly all skin surfaces.
Many parts of the body. With this most common type, called generalized vitiligo, the discolored patches often progress similarly on corresponding body parts (symmetrically).
Only one side or part of the body. This type, called segmental vitiligo, tends to occur at a younger age, progress for a year or two, then stop.
One or only a few areas of the body. This type is called localized (focal) vitiligo.
The face and hands. With this type, called acrofacial vitiligo, the affected skin is on the face and hands, and around body openings, such as the eyes, nose and ears.
It's difficult to predict how this disease will progress. Sometimes the patches stop forming without treatment. In most cases, pigment loss spreads and eventually involves most of the skin. Occasionally, the skin gets its color back.",,,

Primary Stage
A single chancre marks the onset of the primary (first) stage of syphilis, but there may be multiple sores. The chancre is usually (but not always) firm, round, and painless. It appears at the location where syphilis enters the body. These painless chancres can occur in locations that make them difficult to notice (e.g., the vagina or anus). The chancre lasts 3 to 6 weeks and heals regardless of whether a person receives treatment. However, the infection will progress to the secondary stage if the person with syphilis does not receive treatment.

Secondary Stage
Skin rashes and/or mucous membrane lesions (sores in the mouth, vagina, or anus) mark the second stage of symptoms. This stage typically starts with the development of a rash on one or more areas of the body. Rashes during the secondary stage:

can appear when the primary chancre is healing or several weeks after the chancre heals.
usually does not cause itching.
may appear as rough, red, or reddish-brown spots on the palm of the hands and bottoms of the feet. However, rashes with a different appearance may occur on other parts of the body. Sometimes they resemble rashes caused by other diseases.
may be so faint they are hard to notice.
Condyloma lata are large, raised, gray or white lesions. They may develop in warm, moist areas like the mouth, underarm or groin region.

In addition to rashes, signs and symptoms of secondary syphilis may include:

fever
swollen lymph nodes
sore throat
patchy hair loss
headaches
weight loss
muscle aches
fatigue
The symptoms of secondary syphilis will go away with or without treatment. However, without treatment, the infection will progress to the latent and possibly tertiary stage of disease.

Latent Stage
The latent (hidden) stage of syphilis is a period when there are no visible signs or symptoms of syphilis. Without treatment, syphilis will remain in the body even though there are no signs or symptoms. Early latent syphilis is latent syphilis where infection occurs within the past 12 months. Late latent syphilis is latent syphilis where infection occurs more than 12 months ago. Latent syphilis of unknown duration is when there is not enough evidence to confirm initial infection was within the previous 12 months. Latent syphilis can last for years.

Tertiary Syphilis
Tertiary syphilis is rare and develops in a subset of untreated syphilis infections. It can appear 10–30 years after a person gets the infection, and it can be fatal. Tertiary syphilis can affect multiple organ systems, including the:

brain
nerves
eyes
heart
blood vessels
liver

These symptoms usually go away on their own and can be mistaken for flu-like illness. Some people may have no early symptoms at all and may feel healthy. The only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested.

Over time, HIV infection damages the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections and other diseases, including heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer. Left untreated, HIV infection can lead to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). AIDS is the most severe phase of HIV infection.

The average incubation period for an initial herpes infection is 4 days (range, 2 to 12) after exposure. 10 The vesicles break and leave painful ulcers that may take two to four weeks to heal after the initial herpes infection. 5,10 Experiencing these symptoms is referred to as having a first herpes “outbreak” or episode.

Clinical manifestations of genital herpes differ between the first and recurrent (i.e., subsequent) outbreaks. The first outbreak of herpes is often associated with a longer duration of herpetic lesions, increased viral shedding (making HSV transmission more likely) and systemic symptoms including fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, or headache. 5,10 Recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes are common, and many patients who recognize recurrences have prodromal symptoms, either localized genital pain, or tingling or shooting pains in the legs, hips or buttocks, which occur hours to days before the eruption of herpetic lesions. 5 Symptoms of recurrent outbreaks are typically shorter in duration and less severe than the first outbreak of genital herpes. 5 Long-term studies have indicated that the number of symptomatic recurrent outbreaks may decrease over time. 5 Recurrences and subclinical shedding are much less frequent for genital HSV-1 infection than for genital HSV-2 infection.5",,,

Eczema or a hive-like rash
Small blisters or sores in the mouth or other mucous membranes (benign mucous membrane pemphigoid)
See your doctor if you develop:
Unexplained blistering
Blisters on your eyes
Signs of infection
The blisters occur because of a malfunction in your immune system.Your body's immune system normally produces antibodies to fight bacteria, viruses or other potentially harmful foreign substances. For reasons that are not clear, the body may develop an antibody to a particular tissue in your body.In bullous pemphigoid, the immune system produces antibodies to the fibers that connect the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the next layer of skin (dermis). These antibodies trigger inflammation that produces the blisters and itching of bullous pemphigoid.Bullous pemphigoid usually appears randomly with no clear factors contributing to the onset of disease. Some cases may be triggered by:
Medications. Prescription drugs that may cause bullous pemphigoid include etanercept (Enbrel), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), furosemide (Lasix) and penicillin.
Light and radiation. Ultraviolet light therapy to treat certain skin conditions may trigger bullous pemphigoid, as can radiation therapy to treat cancer.
Medical conditions. Disorders that may trigger bullous pemphigoid include psoriasis, lichen planus, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.

For infants, severe blistering can be life-threatening.Seek immediate medical care if you or your child:
Has problems swallowing
Has problems breathing
Shows signs of infection, such as warm, painful or swollen skin, pus, or an odor from a sore, and fever or chills
Epidermolysis bullosa is caused by an inherited gene. You may inherit the disease gene from one parent who has the disease (autosomal dominant inheritance) or from both parents (autosomal recessive inheritance).The skin is made up of an outer layer (epidermis) and an underlying layer (dermis). The area where the layers meet is called the basement membrane. The types of epidermolysis bullosa are mainly defined by which layers separate and form blisters. The skin injury might be brought on by a minor injury, bump or nothing at all.The main types of epidermolysis bullosa are:
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex. This is the most common type. It's brought on by heat and friction and develops in the outer layer of skin. It mainly affects the palms and feet. The blisters heal without scarring.
Junctional epidermolysis bullosa. This type may be severe, with blisters beginning in infancy. A baby with this condition may develop a hoarse-sounding cry from continual blistering and scarring of the vocal cords.
Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. This type is related to a flaw in the gene that helps produce a protein that glues the skin layers together. If this protein is missing or doesn't function, the layers of the skin won't join properly. It can cause skin that looks thin. Diseased mucous membranes can cause constipation and make it hard to eat.
Kindler syndrome. This type tends to cause blisters in multiple layers and so can look very different from person to person. The blisters tend to show up in infancy or early childhood. It increases sun sensitivity and causes skin to look thin, mottled and wrinkly.
Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is distinct from these conditions, as it isn't inherited and it's rare in children.The major risk factor for developing epidermolysis bullosa is having a family history of the disorder.Epidermolysis bullosa can worsen even with treatment, so it's important to spot signs of complications early. Complications may include:
Infection. Blistering skin can become infected by bacteria.
Bloodstream infection. Sepsis occurs when bacteria from an infection enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. Sepsis can spread rapidly and lead to shock and organ failure.
Fusion of fingers and changes in the joints. Severe forms of epidermolysis bullosa can bind together fingers or toes and cause unusual bending of the joints (contractures). This can affect the function of the fingers, knees and elbows.
Problems with nutrition. Blisters in the mouth can make eating difficult and lead to malnutrition and anemia, such as low iron levels in the blood. Problems with nutrition can also cause delayed wound healing and slowed growth in children.
Constipation. Difficulty passing stool may be due to painful blisters in the anal area. It can also be caused by not ingesting enough liquids or high-fiber foods, such as fruits and vegetables.
Dental problems. Tooth decay and problems with tissues inside the mouth are common with some types of epidermolysis bullosa.
Skin cancer. Teenagers and adults with certain types of epidermolysis bullosa are at increased risk of a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.
Death. Infants with severe junctional epidermolysis bullosa are at high risk of infections and loss of body fluids from widespread blistering. Blisters in the mouth and throat also make it harder to eat and breathe. Many of these infants don't survive.
It's not possible to prevent epidermolysis bullosa. But these steps may help prevent blisters and infection.
Handle your child gently. Your infant or child needs cuddling, but be very gentle. To pick up a child with epidermolysis bullosa, place the child on soft material and give support under the buttocks and behind the neck. Don't lift the child from under the arms.
Take special care with the diaper area. If your child wears diapers, remove the elastic bands and avoid cleansing wipes. Line the diaper with a nonstick dressing or spread it with a thick layer of zinc oxide paste.
Keep the home environment cool. Try to keep your home cool and the temperature steady.
Keep the skin moist. Gently apply moisturizer as needed throughout the day.
Dress your child in soft clothes. Use soft clothing that's simple to get on and off. It may help to remove labels and put on clothing seam-side out to reduce scratching. Try sewing foam pads into the lining of clothing by elbows, knees and other pressure points. Use soft special shoes, if possible.
Prevent scratching. Trim your child's fingernails regularly.
Encourage your child to be active. As your child grows, encourage activities that reduce the risk of skin injury. Swimming is a good option. For children with mild forms of epidermolysis bullosa, they can protect the skin by wearing long pants and sleeves for outdoor activities.
Cover hard surfaces. Consider padding a car seat or bathing tub with sheepskin, foam or a thick towel. Soft cotton or silk can be used as a top layer over the padding.",,,

0,Tinea Ringworm Candidiasis and other Fungal Infections,actinomycosis,https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/anaerobic-bacteria/actinomycosis,"  The characteristic lesion of actinomycosis is an indurated area of multiple, small, communicating abscesses surrounded by granulation tissue. Lesions tend to form sinus tracts that communicate to the skin and drain a purulent discharge containing â€œsulfurâ€ granules (rounded or spherical, usually yellowish, and â‰¤ 1 mm in diameter). Sulfur granules, which do not contain sulfur, are so named because of their yellow appearance; they consist of a tangled mass of the branching filaments of Actinomyces. Infection spreads to contiguous tissues but only rarely hematogenously.   The cervicofacial form usually begins as a small, flat, hard swelling, with or without pain, under the oral mucosa or the skin of the neck or as a subperiosteal swelling of the jaw. Subsequently, areas of softening appear and develop into sinuses and fistulas that discharge the characteristic sulfur granules. The cheek, tongue, pharynx, salivary glands, cranial bones, meninges, or brain may be affected, usually by direct extension. In the abdominal form, the intestines (usually the cecum and appendix) and the peritoneum are infected. Pain, fever, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, and emaciation are characteristic. One or more abdominal masses develop and cause signs of partial intestinal obstruction. Draining sinuses and intestinal fistulas may develop and extend to the external abdominal wall. In the localized pelvic form, patients who use an IUD have vaginal discharge and pelvic or lower abdominal pain. In the thoracic form, lung involvement resembles tuberculosis (TB). Extensive invasion may occur before chest pain, fever, and productive cough appear. Perforation of the chest wall, with chronic draining sinuses, may result. In the generalized form, infection spreads hematogenously to multiple areas, including the skin, vertebral bodies, brain, liver, kidneys, ureters, and, in women, pelvic organs. Diverse symptoms (eg, back pain, headache, abdominal pain) related to these sites may occur. ",,,

But any part of the body can be affected. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the size or location of the growths.Although symptoms are different for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include:
Skin changes. Skin changes are most common. These include patches of lighter skin and small areas of thickened, smooth or bumpy skin. On the forehead, skin can have raised, discolored areas. Small soft bumps under or around the nails may occur. Growths on the face that start in childhood and look like acne are common.
Seizures. Growths in the brain may be linked with seizures. A seizure is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm involves stiffening of the arms and legs and arching the back and head.
Problems in thinking, reasoning and learning. Tuberous sclerosis can result in developmental delays. Sometimes it limits the ability to think, reason and learn. Mental health conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also can occur.
Behavior problems. Common behavior problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment.
Kidney problems. Growths on the kidneys are common, and more growths may develop with age.
Heart issues. Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as a child gets older.
Lung problems. Growths that develop in the lungs may cause coughing or trouble breathing, especially with physical activity or exercise. These lung tumors occur more often in females than in males.
Eye problems. Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. These growths usually don't interfere with vision.
Dental changes. Teeth may have pits in the surface. Small growths may appear on the gums, inside of the cheeks and on the tongue.
Symptoms of tuberous sclerosis may be noticed at birth. Or the first symptoms may appear during childhood or even years later in adulthood.Contact your child's health care provider if you're concerned about your child's development or you notice any symptoms of tuberous sclerosis.Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder caused by gene changes â€” sometimes called mutations â€” in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene. These genes are thought to prevent cells from growing too fast or in an out-of-control way. Changes in either of these genes can cause cells to grow and divide more than needed. This leads to multiple growths throughout the body. These growths are considered noncancerous tumors.Tuberous sclerosis can be the result of either:
A random cell division error. About two-thirds of people who have tuberous sclerosis have a new change in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene linked with tuberous sclerosis. Most people do not have a family history of tuberous sclerosis.
A gene change passed down in families. About one-third of people who have tuberous sclerosis get a changed TSC1 or TSC2 gene from a parent who has the disorder.
If you have tuberous sclerosis, you have up to a 50% chance of passing the changed gene and the disorder to your biological children, which means children related to you by blood may inherit that gene. How bad the disorder gets may vary. A parent with tuberous sclerosis may have a child who has a milder or a more severe form of the disorder.Depending on where the noncancerous tumors grow and their size, they can cause severe or life-threatening complications. Here are some examples:
Too much fluid in and around the brain. One type of noncancerous brain growth, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, can grow along the lining of the fluid-filled spaces in the brain, called ventricles. The tumor can block the flow of fluid that helps protect the brain, causing fluid to build up around the brain. This buildup is called hydrocephalus. Symptoms can include a head size that is larger than expected, nausea, headaches and behavior changes.
Heart complications. Growths in the heart, usually in infants, can block blood flow or cause problems with heart rhythm.
Kidney damage. Growths in the kidney can be large and cause potentially serious â€” even life-threatening â€” kidney problems. Growths in the kidney can cause high blood pressure or bleeding or lead to kidney failure. Rarely, kidney growths can become cancerous.
Lung failure. Growths in the lungs damage the lung tissue and can lead to collapsed lungs. The growths interfere with how well the lungs can provide oxygen to the rest of the body.
Increased risk of cancerous tumors. Tuberous sclerosis is linked with an increased risk of developing cancerous tumors in the kidneys and brain.
Vision damage. Growths in the eye can interfere with vision if they block too much of the retina, though this is rare.",,,

Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to know if you have any of these precancerous growths on your skin. The following pictures show some diverse ways that it can appear.A rough-feeling patch on skin that's had lots of sun. You can often feel an AK before you see it.This man said that a small patch of skin on the back of his neck felt like sandpaper. Later, a visible AK appeared on his sandpaper-like patch of skin.One or more rough, scaly bumps that may look like pimples or spots of irritated skin.The arrows on this womanâ€™s face point to actinic keratoses.Many scaly, raised spots on the skin that may look like a rash or acne breakout.Many of the spots on this womanâ€™s forehead, nose, and cheeks are actinic keratoses.A raised, rough-feeling patch on your skin that may be red, pink, skin-colored, or gray.The reddish, pink patch below this manâ€™s sideburn is an actinic keratosis.Flat, scaly area that looks like an age spot. AKs more commonly look like age spots in people who have skin of color.The spot on this manâ€™s nose may look like an age spot, but itâ€™s actually an actinic keratosis. AKs more commonly look like age spots in people who have skin of color. A dry, scaly lip that never heals (or heals and returns).It may look like this man has a badly chapped lower lip, but the white, dry, and cracked skin is actually a precancerous growth.Scaly, white patches on one (or both) lips. White patches on your lips can be a sign that you have a precancerous condition on your lips.White patches on your lips can be a sign that you have a precancerous condition on your lips.Loss of color on one or both lips.About half the color on this manâ€™s lower lip has disappeared, turning his lip the same color as the skin on his face.Growth that looks like an animalâ€™s horn. When an AK appears in this form, it often indicates that the person has a higher risk of developing a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. A board-certified dermatologist should examine any horn-like growth on your skin ASAP.When an actinic keratosis appears in this form, it often indicates that the person has a higher risk of developing a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.As the above pictures show, AKs come in many colors.

0,Light Diseases and Disorders of Pigmentation,Albinism,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184,"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:
Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).
Sunburn and no ability to tan.
For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:
Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.
An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.
Legal blindness â€” vision less than 20/200 â€” or complete blindness.
At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision.If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider.Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes.Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.Types of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected.
Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene â€” one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. OCA is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from OCA1 to OCA8. OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.
Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than OCA.
Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes can occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.
Albinism can include skin and eye complications. It also can include social and emotional challenges.Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive.People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced.Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition.People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress.Using the term ""person with albinism"" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. The counselor can explain the available genetic tests.",,,

0,Light Diseases and Disorders of Pigmentation,Pseudoporphyria,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/porphyria/symptoms-causes/syc-20356066,"Symptoms can vary widely by type of porphyria and in how severe the symptoms are. Symptoms also can vary among people with the condition. Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms.Acute porphyrias include forms of the disease that usually cause nervous system symptoms. A few forms also can affect the skin. Symptoms appear quickly and can be severe. Symptoms may last hours, days or weeks.The most common form of acute porphyria is called acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP may last hours or days. Intermittent means that the symptoms may go away but return later. When the symptoms occur they are sometimes called attacks.Symptoms of acute porphyrias may include:
Severe pain in the belly, chest, legs or back.
Digestive problems, such as constipation, nausea and vomiting.
Muscle pain, tingling, numbness, weakness or paralysis.
Red or brown urine.
Mental changes, such as anxiety, hallucinations or mental confusion.
Rapid or irregular heartbeats you can feel, called palpitations.
Breathing problems.
High blood pressure.
Seizures.
Cutaneous porphyrias include forms of the disease that cause skin symptoms as a result of sensitivity to sunlight. These forms usually don't affect the nervous system. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of all the porphyrias.Sun exposure may cause:
Sensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain in the skin.
Sudden painful skin redness and swelling.
Blisters on exposed skin, usually the hands, arms and face.
Fragile thin skin with changes in skin color.
Itching.
Too much hair growth in affected areas.
Red or brown urine.
Erythropoietic protoporphyria (uh-rith-roe-poi-ET-ik pro-toe-por-FEAR-e-uh), also called EPP, is a rare type of cutaneous porphyria. It's the most common childhood porphyria. Sun or artificial light exposure quickly results in painful skin burning, irritation and swelling. Small bumps and blisters also appear. Repeated exposures can cause thick, leathery skin and scarring.Many symptoms of porphyria are like those of other, more common conditions. This can make it difficult to know if you're having an attack of porphyria. If you have symptoms that could be porphyria, get medical attention. Prompt treatment is important.All types of porphyria involve a problem making heme. Heme is a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Heme also plays a role in clearing drugs and hormones from the body.Heme is made in the bone marrow and liver. This process involves eight different enzymes that turn porphyrins into heme. A shortage or change in any of these enzymes causes a buildup of porphyrins. Which enzyme is affected determines the type of porphyria.In cutaneous porphyrias, porphyrins build up in the skin. When exposed to sunlight, they cause symptoms. In acute porphyrias, the buildup affects the nervous system, causing symptoms.Most forms of porphyria are caused by a gene change passed down from one or both parents. Porphyria can occur if you inherit:
A changed gene from one of your parents (autosomal dominant pattern).
Changed genes from both parents (autosomal recessive pattern).
Just because you inherit a gene or genes that can cause porphyria doesn't mean that you'll have symptoms. You might never have symptoms. This also is the case for most carriers of the changed genes.Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) usually is not passed down in families. In PCT, certain triggers can cause a buildup of porphyrins that may cause symptoms. Examples of triggers include:
Too much iron in the body, often due to a condition called hemochromatosis, which is caused by a gene change.
Viral infections, such as HIV or hepatitis C.
Heavy alcohol use.
Smoking.
Hormones changes during the menstrual period.
In addition to genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors may trigger symptoms in porphyria. When exposed to the trigger, the body's demand for heme production increases. This overwhelms the low level of a needed enzyme, setting in motion a process that causes a buildup of porphyrins.Examples of triggers include:
Exposure to sunlight.
Certain medicines, for example, birth control pills, sedatives and barbiturates.
Recreational or illicit drugs.
Dieting or fasting.
Smoking.
Physical stress, such as infections or other illnesses or surgery.
Emotional stress.
Alcohol use.
Hormone changes during the menstrual period.
Possible complications depend on the form of porphyria:
Acute porphyrias can be life-threatening if an attack isn't promptly treated. During an attack, you may experience dehydration from loss of fluids, breathing problems, seizures or high blood pressure. You may need a stay in the hospital for treatment. Long-term complications with repeat acute attacks may include long-term pain, chronic kidney failure, liver damage or liver cancer.
Cutaneous porphyrias can result in permanent skin damage. And the skin blisters can become infected. When your skin heals after symptoms, it may have a changed appearance and coloring, be fragile and slow to heal, or leave scars. Cutaneous porphyrias also increase the risk of liver damage or liver cancer.
In rare cases, a bone marrow transplant or liver transplant may be needed.Although there's no way to prevent porphyria, if you have the condition, avoid triggers to help prevent symptoms.Because porphyria is usually an inherited disorder, your siblings and other family members may want to consider genetic testing to determine if they have the condition. Genetic counseling is important to help understand test results and risks.",,,

Vitiligo can start at any age, but usually appears before age 30.Depending on the type of vitiligo you have, it may affect:
Nearly all skin surfaces. With this type, called universal vitiligo, the discoloration affects nearly all skin surfaces.
Many parts of the body. With this most common type, called generalized vitiligo, the discolored patches often progress similarly on corresponding body parts (symmetrically).
Only one side or part of the body. This type, called segmental vitiligo, tends to occur at a younger age, progress for a year or two, then stop.

0,Atopic Dermatitis,Atopic,https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/atopic-dermatitis/symptoms,"Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is often called the â€œitch that rashes.â€ This description explains what happens when the condition begins. It tends to start suddenly with very itchy skin. Scratching the itchy skin often causes a rash. A rash may develop on one or several areas of the skin.Once atopic dermatitis begins, you may notice one or more of the following:Itchy skinDry, scaly areasRed rash (especially on lighter skin tones)Small, rough bumps (more common in darker skin tones)Dark brown, purple, or grayish areas of skin (darker skin tones)Skin feels warm and maybe swollen (inflammation)Scratch marksRaw skin from scratchingBumps or rashes leaking fluidBlisters that ooze and crust overAfter healing, skin may be lighter or darker where you had  atopic dermatitisFlare-ups can come and go for years. While the skin is healing in one area, flare-ups may occur in other areas. The flare-ups can also occur in the same place again and again.Flare-ups can wax and wane or stop for a while and then start up.Over time, atopic dermatitis can cause the skin to become:Thickened, scaly, and leatheryCrackedWhen this happens, you may see more lines on your hands, as shown here, or feet.Thickened skin tends to itch most of the time. Treating atopic dermatitis before the skin thickens can help prevent thickened, itchy skin.Where atopic dermatitis develops on the body tends to vary with age. The signs can also differ with race. The following pictures of atopic dermatitis show what you may see.While atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere, babies and young children often develop it on their cheeks, forehead, or scalp. Flare-ups can later also appear on the trunk, legs, or arms. On lighter skin tones, you often see a red rash with bumps (A). Children with darker skin tones may have several bumps with or without redness and darker areas of skin, like on this boyâ€™s forehead (B).Atopic dermatitis is intensely itchy. When babies have itchy skin, they rub against something. The rubbing can cause bumps, which can ooze and then crust over.You may see dry, scaly skin on any area of your babyâ€™s body. If your baby often rubs up against objects to relieve the itch of the dry, scaly skin, your baby may develop raw skin.The discomfort caused by the itch, rash, and dry skin can cause your baby to act fussy or have trouble sleeping. Lack of sleep is common in anyone who has atopic dermatitis, including babies and young children.As children grow and develop, atopic dermatitis often changes. Hereâ€™s what you may see.Between 2 years of age and puberty, the condition often affects these areas of the body. Children with lighter skin tones often develop an itchy rash in the creases of their elbows or backs of their knees. If your child has a darker skin tone, patches tend to form on the fronts of the knees, elbows, and backs of their hands. Other common places for atopic dermatitis to appear are the neck, wrists, and ankles. Children with brown or black skin are more likely than white children to have atopic dermatitis on their trunk.These creases, which are called Dennie-Morgan folds, also develop in people who have asthma or hay fever.Older children and teenagers may have small, itchy bumps on their skin instead of a weepy rash. Scratching can cause the spots to leak fluid and then crust over. On darker skin tones, the bumps tend to be gray to violet-brown in color.Skin that is constantly rubbed or scratched can thicken. This helps protect the skin. Thickened skin is often excessively dry and itches most of the time.Atopic dermatitis usually begins early in life and may go away during childhood or the teen years. Some people continue to have this condition as adults. Itâ€™s also possible for atopic dermatitis to begin when youâ€™re an adult.In adults, atopic dermatitis can take many forms. For some people, the condition looks the same as when they were a child or teenager. Adults may also develop the following:Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis on their hands. In fact, the hands may be the only place adults have the condition.Adults are more likely than children to have atopic dermatitis around their eyes. Youâ€™ll often see thickened skin thatâ€™s darker than the surrounding skin.If youâ€™ve had  atopic dermatitis for years, patches of your skin may have permanently thickened and developed a leathery texture, as shown here. This is caused by years of scratching. The affected skin also tends to look darker (or lighter) than the surrounding skin. The thickened skin can itch all the time, even when you donâ€™t have a flare-up.Discolored, extremely dry, and itchy skin: Adults may develop discolored skin thatâ€™s extremely dry and easily irritated. This often develops on the hands or feet, but it can occur anywhere. Some adults have nipple eczema, which can be itchy and painful. The dry, cracked skin and scratching make the skin more susceptible to infection. Infections that people with  atopic dermatitis can develop include: Yellow or golden crusts on the skin, like the ones above this childâ€™s lip, often indicate a staph infection. If you see golden or yellowish crusts, contact your dermatologistâ€™s office.Molluscum contagiosum: Having atopic dermatitis increases the risk of getting this common viral infection, which causes small bumps on the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, dermatologists often recommend treating molluscum, especially if it triggers a flare-up of atopic dermatitis.Eczema herpeticum: This is a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms include dome-shaped blisters and bumps, along with fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In children, babies, and anyone who is immunocompromised, eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care.Many studies find that having atopic dermatitis can cause people to feel anxious, depressed, or both. This is often due to the itch, pain, and problems sleeping. These feelings can also be triggered by flare-ups. Some people say they feel ashamed when others see flare-ups on their skin.When people feel anxious or depressed, they often spend more time alone. This can cause people to feel isolated.While studying atopic dermatitis, researchers have also discovered that some people are more likely than others to develop it.

On brown and Black skin, the growth may be lighter than unaffected skin
Hard, thickened skin (callus) over a spot on the skin, where a wart has grown inward
Black pinpoints, which are small clotted blood vessels commonly called wart seeds
A cluster of growths on the sole of the foot (mosaic warts)
A growth that interrupts the normal lines and ridges in the skin of your foot
Pain or tenderness when walking or standing
See your health care provider for the growth on your foot if:
The growth is bleeding, painful or changes in shape or color
You've tried treating the wart, but it persists, multiplies or comes back after clearing for a time (recurs)
Your pain interferes with your activities
You also have diabetes or poor feeling in your feet
You also have a weak immune system because of immune-suppressing drugs, HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders
You aren't sure if the growth is a wart
Plantar warts are caused by an infection with HPV in the outer layer of skin on the soles of the feet. The warts develop when the virus enters through tiny cuts, breaks or weak spots on the bottom of the foot. If left untreated, warts can last from a few months to 2 years in children, and several years in in adults.HPV is very common, and more than 100 kinds of the virus exist. But only a few of them cause warts on the feet. Other types of HPV are more likely to cause warts on other areas of your skin or on mucous membranes.Each person's immune system responds differently to HPV. Not everyone who comes in contact with it develops warts. Even people in the same family react to the virus differently.The HPV strains that cause plantar warts aren't highly contagious. So the virus isn't easily spread by direct contact from one person to another. But it thrives in warm, moist places, so you might get the virus by walking barefoot around swimming pools or locker rooms. If the virus spreads from the first site of infection, more warts may grow.Anyone can develop plantar warts, but this type of wart is more likely to affect:
Children and teenagers
People with weak immune systems
People who have had plantar warts before
People who walk barefoot in areas where a wart-causing virus is common, such as locker rooms and swimming pools
When plantar warts cause pain, you may alter your normal posture or gait â€” perhaps without realizing it. Eventually, this change in how you stand, walk or run can cause muscle or joint discomfort.To help prevent plantar warts:
Avoid direct contact with warts. This includes your own warts. Wash your hands carefully after touching a wart.
Keep your feet clean and dry.
Wear sandals or other foot protection when walking around swimming pools, in locker rooms or in gym showers.
Don't pick at or scratch warts.
When using an emery board, pumice stone or nail clipper on your warts, choose one that you don't use on your healthy skin and nails.",,,

0,Poison Ivy and Contact Dermatitis,Poison Ivy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/poison-ivy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376485,"Signs and symptoms of a poison ivy rash include:
Redness
Itching
Swelling
Blisters
Difficulty breathing, if you've inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy
Poison ivy rash often appears in a straight line because of the way the plant brushes against your skin. But if you develop a rash after touching a piece of clothing or pet fur that has urushiol on it, the rash may be more spread out. You can also transfer the oil to other parts of your body with your fingers. The reaction usually develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure and lasts two to three weeks.The severity of the rash depends on the amount of urushiol that gets on your skin.Seek emergency medical attention if:
You inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy and are having difficulty breathing
See your doctor if:
The reaction is severe or widespread
Your skin continues to swell
The rash affects your eyes, mouth or genitals
Blisters are oozing pus
You develop a fever greater than 100 F (37.8 C)
The rash doesn't get better within a few weeks
Poison ivy rash is caused by an allergic reaction to an oily resin called urushiol. It's found in poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac. This oily resin is very sticky, so it easily attaches to your skin, clothing, tools, equipment and pet's fur. You can get a poison ivy reaction from:
Touching the plant. If you touch the leaves, stem, roots or berries of the plant, you may have a reaction.
Touching contaminated objects. If you walk through some poison ivy and then later touch your shoes, you might get urushiol on your hands. You might then transfer it to your face or body by touching or rubbing. If the contaminated object isn't cleaned, the urushiol on it can still cause a skin reaction years later.
Inhaling smoke from the burning plants. Even the smoke from burning poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac can irritate or harm your nasal passages or lungs.
Pus that oozes from blisters doesn't contain urushiol and won't spread the rash. But it's possible to get poison ivy rash from someone if you touch plant resin that's still on the person or contaminated clothing.Your risk of a rash is increased if you participate in outdoor activities that put you at higher risk of exposure to poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac:
Cable or telephone line installation
Camping
Construction
Farming
Firefighting
Fishing from the shoreline
Forestry
Gardening
Hiking
Hunting
Landscaping
If you scratch a poison ivy rash, bacteria under your fingernails may cause the skin to become infected. See your doctor if pus starts oozing from the blisters. Your doctor might prescribe antibiotics. Serious difficulty breathing and inflammation of the lining of the lungs may result from inhaling urushiol.To prevent poison ivy rash, follow these tips:

Avoid the plants. Learn how to identify poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac in all seasons. When hiking or engaging in other activities that might expose you to these plants, try to stay on cleared pathways. Wear socks, pants and long sleeves when outdoors. If camping, make sure you pitch your tent in an area free of these plants.
Keep pets from running through wooded areas so that urushiol doesn't stick to their fur, which you then may touch.

Wear protective clothing. If needed, protect your skin by wearing socks, boots, pants, long sleeves and heavy gloves.
Remove or kill the plants. Identify and remove poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac from your yard or garden. You can get rid of such plants by applying an herbicide or pulling them out of the ground, including the roots, while wearing heavy gloves. Afterward remove the gloves carefully and wash them and your hands. Don't burn poison ivy or related plants because the urushiol can be carried by the smoke.

Wash your skin or your pet's fur. Within 30 minutes after exposure to urushiol, use soap and water to gently wash off the harmful resin from your skin. Scrub under your fingernails too. Even washing after an hour or so can help reduce the severity of the rash.
If you think your pet may be contaminated with urushiol, put on some long rubber gloves and give your pet a bath.


Clean contaminated objects. If you think you've come into contact with poison ivy, wash your clothing promptly in warm soapy water â€” ideally in a washing machine. Handle contaminated clothing carefully so that you don't transfer the urushiol to yourself, furniture, rugs or appliances.
Also wash as soon as possible any other items that came in contact with the plant oil â€” such as outdoor gear, garden tools, jewelry, shoes and even shoelaces. Urushiol can remain potent for years. So if you put away a contaminated jacket without washing it and take it out a year later, the oil on the jacket may still cause a rash.

Apply a barrier cream. Try over-the-counter skin products that are intended to act as a barrier between your skin and the oily resin that causes poison ivy rash.",,,
0,Acne and Rosacea,Acne,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acne/symptoms-causes/syc-20368047,"Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition:
Whiteheads (closed plugged pores)
Blackheads (open plugged pores)
Small red, tender bumps (papules)
Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips
Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules)
Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions)
Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.If self-care remedies don't clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications. If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist).For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation. This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives.In older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction. This type of reaction is quite rare, so don't confuse it with any redness, irritation or itchiness that occurs in areas where you've applied medications or products.Seek emergency medical help if after using a skin product you experience:
Faintness
Difficulty breathing
Swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue
Tightness of the throat
Four main factors cause acne:
Excess oil (sebum) production
Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells
Bacteria
Inflammation
Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air.Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne.Certain things may trigger or worsen acne:
Hormonal changes. Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too.
Certain medications. Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium.
Diet. Studies indicate that consuming certain foods â€” including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips â€” may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions.
Stress. Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse.
These factors have little effect on acne:
Chocolate and greasy foods. Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne.
Hygiene. Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse.
Cosmetics. Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs.
People with darker skin types are more likely than are people with lighter skin to experience these acne complications:
Scars. Pitted skin (acne scars) and thick scars (keloids) can remain long-term after acne has healed.
Skin changes. After acne has cleared, the affected skin may be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than before the condition occurred.
Risk factors for acne include:
Age. People of all ages can get acne, but it's most common in teenagers.
Hormonal changes. Such changes are common during puberty or pregnancy.
Family history. Genetics plays a role in acne. If both of your parents had acne, you're likely to develop it too.
Greasy or oily substances. You may develop acne where your skin comes into contact with oil or oily lotions and creams.
Friction or pressure on your skin. This can be caused by items such as telephones, cellphones, helmets, tight collars and backpacks.",,,
0,Acne and Rosacea,Hidradenitis suppurativa,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hidradenitis-suppurativa/symptoms-causes/syc-20352306,"Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body. Signs and symptoms of the condition include:
Blackheads. Blackheads appear in small, pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs.
Painful pea-sized lumps. The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts.
Leaking bumps or sores. Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor.
Tunnels. Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus.
Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable. Excess weight and being a smoker are associated with worse symptoms, but people who are thin and don't smoke can experience severe disease.Early diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa is key to effective treatment. See your dermatologist if your condition:
Is painful.
Makes it difficult to move.
Doesn't improve in a few weeks.
Returns within weeks of treatment.
Appears in several locations.
Flares often.
Your dermatologist can create a treatment plan for you.Hidradenitis suppurativa is not just a boil, and many people with this condition also have related conditions. People with hidradenitis suppurativa benefit from a health care team with medical and surgical dermatologists at the core. Other specialists are involved as needed.Hidradenitis suppurativa develops when hair follicles become blocked, but why this blockage occurs isn't known. Experts think it could be connected to hormones, genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking or excess weight.An infection or being unclean does not cause hidradenitis suppurativa, and it can't be spread to other people.Factors that increase your chance of developing hidradenitis suppurativa include:
Age. The risk of hidradenitis suppurativa is higher for people in their teens and 20s.
Sex. Females are more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa than males.
Race. Ethnicity or race might affect risk level. The condition occurs most in Black people, possibly due to genetic factors.
Family history. A tendency to develop hidradenitis suppurativa can be inherited.
Certain conditions. Hidradenitis suppurativa is more common and severe in people who are overweight. It also has an association with severe acne, arthritis, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
Smoking. Smoking tobacco has been linked to hidradenitis suppurativa.
Persistent and severe hidradenitis suppurativa can cause complications, including:
Infection. Secondary infection is possible in the affected area, but the presence of pus is common in hidradenitis suppurativa and doesn't necessarily mean infection.
Scars and skin changes. The wounds may heal but leave ropelike scars or pitted skin.
Restricted movement. Sores and scar tissue can cause limited or painful movement, especially when the disease affects the armpits or thighs.
Skin cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma has been reported with long-term hidradenitis suppurativa, particularly in people whose condition involves the perianal area. This area consists of the tissues around the anus.
Swelling in the arms, legs or genitals. The most common sites for hidradenitis suppurativa also contain many lymph nodes. Scar tissue can interfere with the lymph drainage system, which can cause the arms, legs or genitals to swell.
Psychological effects and social isolation. The location, drainage and odor of the sores can cause embarrassment and reluctance to go out in public, leading to anxiety or depression.

Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children)
Dry, cracked skin that may bleed
Itching, burning or soreness
Cyclic rashes that flare for a few weeks or months and then subside
There are several types of psoriasis, each of which varies in its signs and symptoms:
Plaque psoriasis. The most common type of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis causes dry, itchy, raised skin patches (plaques) covered with scales. There may be few or many. They usually appear on the elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. The patches vary in color, depending on skin color. The affected skin might heal with temporary changes in color (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation), particularly on brown or Black skin.
Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe disease may cause the nail to crumble.
Guttate psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling spots on the trunk, arms or legs.
Inverse psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. It causes smooth patches of inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis.
Pustular psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis, a rare type, causes clearly defined pus-filled blisters. It can occur in widespread patches or on small areas of the palms or soles.
Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. It can be short-lived (acute) or long-term (chronic).
If you suspect that you may have psoriasis, see your health care provider. Also seek medical care if your condition:
Becomes severe or widespread
Causes you discomfort and pain
Causes you concern about the appearance of your skin
Doesn't improve with treatment
Psoriasis is thought to be an immune system problem that causes skin cells to grow faster than usual. In the most common type of psoriasis, known as plaque psoriasis, this rapid turnover of cells results in dry, scaly patches.The cause of psoriasis isn't fully understood. It's thought to be an immune system problem where infection-fighting cells attack healthy skin cells by mistake. Researchers believe that both genetics and environmental factors play a role. The condition is not contagious.Many people who are predisposed to psoriasis may be free of symptoms for years until the disease is triggered by some environmental factor. Common psoriasis triggers include:
Infections, such as strep throat or skin infections
Weather, especially cold, dry conditions
Injury to the skin, such as a cut or scrape, a bug bite, or a severe sunburn
Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke
Heavy alcohol consumption
Certain medications â€” including lithium, high blood pressure drugs and antimalarial drugs
Rapid withdrawal of oral or injected corticosteroids
Anyone can develop psoriasis. About a third of instances begin in childhood. These factors can increase the risk of developing the disease:
Family history. The condition runs in families. Having one parent with psoriasis increases your risk of getting the disease. And having two parents with psoriasis increases your risk even more.
Smoking. Smoking tobacco not only increases the risk of psoriasis but also may increase the severity of the disease.
If you have psoriasis, you're at greater risk of developing other conditions, including:
Psoriatic arthritis, which causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in and around the joints
Temporary skin color changes (post-inflammatory hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation) where plaques have healed
Eye conditions, such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis and uveitis
Obesity

0,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,Morphea,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/morphea/symptoms-causes/syc-20375283,"Signs and symptoms of morphea vary depending on the type and stage of the condition. They include:
Reddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back
Patches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center
Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp
A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny
Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone. The condition generally lasts several years and then improves or at times disappears by itself. It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin. It is possible for morphea to recur.See your doctor if you notice reddish patches of hardening or thickening skin. Early diagnosis and treatment may help slow the development of new patches and allow your doctor to identify and treat complications before they worsen.The cause of morphea is unknown. It may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system. In people at increased risk of morphea, it could be triggered by injury to the affected area, medications, chemical toxins, an infection or radiation therapy.The condition isn't contagious.Certain factors may affect your risk of developing morphea, including:
Being white and female. Morphea is most common in white females.
Age. The condition can affect people at any age. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 14 or in the mid-40s.
A family history of morphea. This condition can run in families. People with morphea are more likely to have a family history of morphea and other autoimmune diseases.
Morphea can cause a number of complications, including:
Self-esteem issues. Morphea can have a negative effect on your self-esteem and body image, particularly if discolored patches of skin appear on your arms, legs or face.
Movement problems. Morphea that affects the arms or legs can impair joint mobility.
Widespread areas of hardened, discolored skin. Numerous new patches of hardened, discolored skin may seem to join together, a condition known as generalized morphea.
Loss of hair and sweat glands. Over time, you may lose hair and sweat glands in the affected area.
Eye damage. Children with head and neck morphea may experience unnoticeable but permanent eye damage.",,,
0,Lupus and other Connective Tissue diseases,scleroderma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scleroderma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351952,"Scleroderma's signs and symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected.Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of the skin.The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:
Heartburn
Difficulty swallowing
Bloating
Diarrhea
Constipation
Fecal incontinence
When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, including your skin.Doctors don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers.Anyone can get scleroderma, but it does occur much more often in women than in men. Several combined factors appear to influence the risk of developing scleroderma:
Genetics. People who have certain gene variations appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. This may explain why a small number of scleroderma cases appear to run in families and why some types of scleroderma are more common for certain ethnic groups.
Environmental triggers. Research suggests that, in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medications or drugs. Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. An environmental trigger is not identified for most people.
Immune system problems. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. People who have scleroderma may also have symptoms of another autoimmune disease â€” such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome.
Scleroderma complications range from mild to severe and can affect the:
Fingertips. In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. In some cases, the tissue on the fingertips may die.
Lungs. Scarring of lung tissue can impact your ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. You may also develop high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs.
Kidneys. A serious kidney complication (scleroderma renal crisis) involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function.
Heart. Scarring of heart tissue increases your risk of abnormal heartbeats and congestive heart failure. Scleroderma can also cause inflammation of the membranous sac surrounding your heart.
Teeth. Severe tightening of facial skin can cause your mouth to become smaller and narrower, which may make it hard to brush your teeth or to even have them professionally cleaned. People who have scleroderma often don't produce normal amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more.
Digestive system. Digestive problems associated with scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. It can also cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. Some people who have scleroderma may also have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine.
Joints. The skin over joints can become so tight that it restricts joint flexibility and movement, particularly in the hands.",,,

Repeatedly pulling your hair out, typically from your scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes, but sometimes from other body areas, and sites may vary over time
An increasing sense of tension before pulling, or when you try to resist pulling
A sense of pleasure or relief after the hair is pulled
Noticeable hair loss, such as shortened hair or thinned or bald areas on the scalp or other areas of your body, including sparse or missing eyelashes or eyebrows
Preference for specific types of hair, rituals that accompany hair pulling or patterns of hair pulling
Biting, chewing or eating pulled-out hair
Playing with pulled-out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face
Repeatedly trying to stop pulling out your hair or trying to do it less often without success
Significant distress or problems at work, school or in social situations related to pulling out your hair
Many people who have trichotillomania also pick their skin, bite their nails or chew their lips. Sometimes pulling hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign. Most people with trichotillomania pull hair in private and generally try to hide the disorder from others.For people with trichotillomania, hair pulling can be:
Focused. Some people pull their hair intentionally to relieve tension or distress â€” for example, pulling hair out to get relief from the overwhelming urge to pull hair. Some people may develop elaborate rituals for pulling hair, such as finding just the right hair or biting pulled hairs.
Automatic. Some people pull their hair without even realizing they're doing it, such as when they're bored, reading or watching TV.
The same person may do both focused and automatic hair pulling, depending on the situation and mood. Certain positions or rituals may trigger hair pulling, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair.Trichotillomania can be related to emotions:
Negative emotions. For many people with trichotillomania, hair pulling is a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, fatigue or frustration.
Positive feelings. People with trichotillomania often find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides a measure of relief. As a result, they continue to pull their hair to maintain these positive feelings.
Trichotillomania is a long-term (chronic) disorder. Without treatment, symptoms can vary in severity over time. For example, the hormonal changes of menstruation can worsen symptoms in women. For some people, if not treated, symptoms can come and go for weeks, months or years at a time. Rarely, hair pulling ends within a few years of starting.If you can't stop pulling out your hair or you feel embarrassed or ashamed by your appearance as a result of your hair pulling, talk to your doctor. Trichotillomania is not just a bad habit, it's a mental health disorder, and it's unlikely to get better without treatment.The cause of trichotillomania is unclear. But like many complex disorders, trichotillomania probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.These factors tend to increase the risk of trichotillomania:
Family history. Genetics may play a role in the development of trichotillomania, and the disorder may occur in those who have a close relative with the disorder.
Age. Trichotillomania usually develops just before or during the early teens â€” most often between the ages of 10 and 13 years â€” and it's often a lifelong problem. Infants also can be prone to hair pulling, but this is usually mild and goes away on its own without treatment.
Other disorders. People who have trichotillomania may also have other disorders, such as depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Stress. Severely stressful situations or events may trigger trichotillomania in some people.
Although far more women than men are treated for trichotillomania, this may be because women are more likely to seek medical advice. In early childhood, boys and girls appear to be equally affected.Although it may not seem particularly serious, trichotillomania can have a major negative impact on your life. Complications may include:
Emotional distress. Many people with trichotillomania report feeling shame, humiliation and embarrassment. They may experience low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and alcohol or street drug use because of their condition.
Problems with social and work functioning. Embarrassment because of hair loss may lead you to avoid social activities and job opportunities. People with trichotillomania may wear wigs, style their hair to disguise bald patches or wear false eyelashes. Some people may avoid intimacy for fear that their condition will be discovered.
Skin and hair damage. Constant hair pulling can cause scarring and other damage, including infections, to the skin on your scalp or the specific area where hair is pulled and can permanently affect hair growth.
Hairballs. Eating your hair may lead to a large, matted hairball (trichobezoar) in your digestive tract. Over a period of years, the hairball can cause weight loss, vomiting, intestinal obstruction and even death.",,,

 Genital warts. These appear as flat lesions, small cauliflower-like bumps or tiny stemlike protrusions. In women, genital warts appear mostly on the vulva but can also occur near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina. In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch or feel tender.
Common warts. Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps and usually occur on the hands and fingers. In most cases, common warts are simply unsightly, but they can also be painful or susceptible to injury or bleeding.
Plantar warts. Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of your feet. These warts might cause discomfort.
Flat warts. Flat warts are flat-topped, slightly raised lesions. They can appear anywhere, but children usually get them on the face and men tend to get them in the beard area. Women tend to get them on the legs.",,,
0,Herpes HPV and other STDs,AIDS,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524,"The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection.Some people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection, may last for a few weeks.Possible signs and symptoms include:
Fever
Headache
Muscle aches and joint pain
Rash
Sore throat and painful mouth sores
Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck
Diarrhea
Weight loss
Cough
Night sweats
These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage.In this stage of infection, HIV is still present in the body and in white blood cells. However, many people may not have any symptoms or infections during this time.This stage can last for many years if you're receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some people develop more severe disease much sooner.As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells â€” the cells in your body that help fight off germs â€” you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as:
Fever
Fatigue
Swollen lymph nodes â€” often one of the first signs of HIV infection
Diarrhea
Weight loss
Oral yeast infection (thrush)
Shingles (herpes zoster)
Pneumonia
Access to better antiviral treatments has dramatically decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide, even in resource-poor countries. Thanks to these life-saving treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years.When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop diseases that wouldn't usually cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system. These are called opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers.The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include:
Sweats
Chills
Recurring fever
Chronic diarrhea
Swollen lymph glands
Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth
Persistent, unexplained fatigue
Weakness
Weight loss
Skin rashes or bumps
If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a health care provider as soon as possible.HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact, illicit injection drug use or sharing needles, contact with infected blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.HIV destroys CD4 T cells â€” white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes.You can have an HIV infection, with few or no symptoms, for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS-defining complication, such as a serious infection or cancer.To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways:
By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity.
By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated injection drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis.
From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. Hospitals and blood banks screen the blood supply for HIV, so this risk is very small in the U.S. and other upper-middle-income countries. The risk may be higher in low-income countries that are not able to screen all donated blood.
During pregnancy or delivery or through breastfeeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. Mothers who are HIV-positive and get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies.
You can't become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you can't catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection.HIV isn't spread through the air, water or insect bites.Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected with HIV/AIDS. However, you're at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you:
Have unprotected sex. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is riskier than is vaginal sex.Â Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners.
Have an STI. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body.
Use illicit injection drugs. People who use illicit injection drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other people's blood.
HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop many infections and certain types of cancers.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). This fungal infection can cause severe illness. Although it's declined significantly with current treatments for HIV/AIDS, in the U.S., PCP is still the most common cause of pneumonia in people infected with HIV.
Candidiasis (thrush). Candidiasis is a common HIV-related infection. It causes inflammation and a thick, white coating on your mouth, tongue, esophagus or vagina.
Tuberculosis (TB). TB is a common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. Worldwide, TB is a leading cause of death among people with AIDS. It's less common in the U.S. thanks to the wide use of HIV medications.
Cytomegalovirus. This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces â€” causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs.
Cryptococcal meningitis. Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection associated with HIV, caused by a fungus found in soil.
Toxoplasmosis. This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Toxoplasmosis can cause heart disease, and seizures occur when it spreads to the brain.

Lymphoma. This cancer starts in the white blood cells. The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, armpit or groin.
Kaposi's sarcoma. A tumor of the blood vessel walls, Kaposi's sarcoma usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposi's sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs.
HPV-related cancers. These are cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. They include anal, oral and cervical cancer.

Wasting syndrome. Untreated HIV/AIDS can cause significant weight loss, often accompanied by diarrhea, chronic weakness and fever.
Neurological complications. HIV can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, forgetfulness, depression, anxiety and difficulty walking. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) can range from mild symptoms of behavioral changes and reduced mental functioning to severe dementia causing weakness and inability to function.
Kidney disease. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is an inflammation of the tiny filters in your kidneys that remove excess fluid and wastes from your blood and pass them to your urine. It most often affects Black or Hispanic people.
Liver disease. Liver disease is also a major complication, especially in people who also have hepatitis B or hepatitis C.
There's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for HIV/AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection.To help prevent the spread of HIV:

Consider preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The combination oral drugs emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy) can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. PrEP can reduce your risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and from injection drug use by at least 74%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have receptive vaginal sex.
The FDA recently approved cabotegravir (Apretude), the first injectable PrEP to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. The injection is given by a health care provider. After the first two monthly injections, cabotegravir is given every two months. The injection is an option in place of a daily PrEP pill.
Your health care provider will prescribe these drugs for HIV prevention only if you don't already have HIV infection. You will need an HIV test before you start taking any PrEP. The test should then be done every three months for pills or before each injection for as long as you're taking PrEP. Your health care provider will also test your kidney function before prescribing Truvada and continue to test it every 6 to 12 months. Other regular testing may also be needed.
You need to take the pill form every day or closely follow the injection schedule for cabotegravir. They don't prevent other STIs, so you'll still need to practice safe sex. If you have hepatitis B, you should be evaluated by an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginning therapy.

Use treatment as prevention (TasP). If you're living with HIV, taking HIV medication can keep your partner from becoming infected with the virus. If you make sure your viral load stays undetectable â€” a blood test doesn't show any virus â€” you won't transmit the virus to anyone else through sex. Using TasP means taking your medication exactly as prescribed and getting regular checkups.
Use post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if you've been exposed to HIV. If you think you've been exposed through sex, needles or in the workplace, contact your health care provider or go to the emergency department. Taking PEP as soon as possible within the first 72 hours can greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected with HIV. You will need to take medication for 28 days.
Use a new condom every time you have sex. Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. Women can use a female condom. If using a lubricant, make sure it's water-based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break. During oral sex use a nonlubricated, cut-open condom or a dental dam â€” a piece of medical-grade latex.
Tell your sexual partners if you have HIV. It's important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that you're HIV-positive. They'll need to be tested.
Use a clean needle. If you use a needle to inject illicit drugs, make sure it's sterile and don't share it. Take advantage of needle-exchange programs in your community. Consider seeking help for your drug use.
If you're pregnant, get medical care right away. If you're HIV-positive, you may pass the infection to your baby. But if you receive treatment during pregnancy, you can significantly cut your baby's risk.
Consider male circumcision. There's evidence that male circumcision can help reduce the risk of getting HIV infection.",,,

In men, they may occur on the tip or shaft of the penis, the scrotum, or the anus.Genital warts can also develop in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sexual contact with an infected person.The signs and symptoms of genital warts include:
Small, flesh-colored, brown or pink swellings in your genital area
A cauliflower-like shape caused by several warts close together
Itching or discomfort in your genital area
Bleeding with intercourse
Genital warts can be so small and flat as to be invisible. Rarely, however, genital warts can multiply into large clusters in someone with a suppressed immune system.See a health care professional if you or your partner develops bumps or warts in the genital area.The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes warts. There are more than 40 strains of HPV that affect the genital area.Genital warts are almost always spread through sexual contact. Your warts don't have to be visible for you to spread the infection to your sexual partner.Most people who are sexually active get infected with genital HPV at some time. Factors that can increase your risk of becoming infected include:
Having unprotected sex with multiple partners
Having had another sexually transmitted infection
Having sex with a partner whose sexual history you don't know
Becoming sexually active at a young age
Having a compromised immune system, such as from HIV or drugs from an organ transplant
HPV infection complications can include:

Cancer. Cervical cancer has been closely linked with genital HPV infection. Certain types of HPV also are associated with cancers of the vulva, anus, penis, and mouth and throat.
HPV infection doesn't always lead to cancer, but it's important for women to have regular Pap tests, particularly those who've been infected with higher risk types of HPV.


Problems during pregnancy. Rarely during pregnancy, warts can enlarge, making it difficult to urinate. Warts on the vaginal wall can inhibit the stretching of vaginal tissues during childbirth. Large warts on the vulva or in the vagina can bleed when stretched during delivery.
Extremely rarely, a baby born to a mother with genital warts develops warts in the throat. The baby might need surgery to keep the airway from being blocked.

Limiting your number of sexual partners and being vaccinated will help prevent you from getting genital warts. Using a condom every time you have sex is a good idea, but won't necessarily protect you from genital warts.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine HPV vaccination for girls and boys ages 11 and 12, although it can be given as early as age 9.It's ideal for girls and boys to receive the vaccine before they have sexual contact.Side effects from the vaccines are usually mild and include soreness at the injection site, headaches, a low-grade fever or flu-like symptoms.The CDC now recommends that all 11- and 12-year-olds receive two doses of HPV vaccine at least six months apart, instead of the previously recommended three-dose schedule. Younger adolescents ages 9 and 10 and teens ages 13 and 14 also are able to receive vaccination on the updated two-dose schedule. Research has shown that the two-dose schedule is effective for children under 15.Teens and young adults who begin the vaccine series later, at ages 15 through 26, should continue to receive three doses of the vaccine.The CDC now recommends catch-up HPV vaccinations for all people through age 26 who aren't adequately vaccinated.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Gardasil 9 for males and females ages 9 to 45. If you're ages 27 to 45, discuss your risks with your health care team to decide if you should get the HPV vaccine.",,,
0,Herpes HPV and other STDs,gonorrhea,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gonorrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20351774,"In many cases, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms. Symptoms, however, can affect many sites in your body, but commonly appear in the genital tract.Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in men include:
Painful urination
Pus-like discharge from the tip of the penis
Pain or swelling in one testicle
Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in women include:
Increased vaginal discharge
Painful urination
Vaginal bleeding between periods, such as after vaginal intercourse
Abdominal or pelvic pain
Gonorrhea can also affect these parts of the body:
Rectum. Signs and symptoms include anal itching, pus-like discharge from the rectum, spots of bright red blood on toilet tissue and having to strain during bowel movements.
Eyes. Gonorrhea that affects your eyes can cause eye pain, sensitivity to light, and pus-like discharge from one or both eyes.
Throat. Signs and symptoms of a throat infection might include a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.
Joints. If one or more joints become infected by bacteria (septic arthritis), the affected joints might be warm, red, swollen and extremely painful, especially during movement.
Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any troubling signs or symptoms, such as a burning sensation when you urinate or a pus-like discharge from your penis, vagina or rectum.Also make an appointment with your doctor if your partner has been diagnosed with gonorrhea. You may not experience signs or symptoms that prompt you to seek medical attention. But without treatment, you can reinfect your partner even after he or she has been treated for gonorrhea.Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse.Sexually active women younger than 25 and men who have sex with men are at increased risk of getting gonorrhea.Other factors that can increase your risk include:
Having a new sex partner
Having a sex partner who has other partners
Having more than one sex partner
Having had gonorrhea or another sexually transmitted infection
Untreated gonorrhea can lead to major complications, such as:
Infertility in women. Gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility. PID requires immediate treatment.
Infertility in men. Gonorrhea can cause a small, coiled tube in the rear portion of the testicles where the sperm ducts are located (epididymis) to become inflamed (epididymitis). Untreated epididymitis can lead to infertility.
Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of your body. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect other parts of your body, including your joints. Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results.
Increased risk of HIV/AIDS. Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS. People who have both gonorrhea and HIV are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners.
Complications in babies. Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections.
To reduce your gonorrhea risk:
Use a condom if you have sex. Abstaining from sex is the surest way to prevent gonorrhea. But if you choose to have sex, use a condom during any type of sexual contact, including anal sex, oral sex or vaginal sex.
Limit your number of sex partners. Being in a monogamous relationship in which neither partner has sex with anyone else can lower your risk.
Be sure you and your partner are tested for sexually transmitted infections. Before you have sex, get tested and share your results with each other.
Don't have sex with someone who appears to have a sexually transmitted infection. If your partner has signs or symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection, such as burning during urination or a genital rash or sore, don't have sex with that person.

Consider regular gonorrhea screening. Annual screening is recommended for sexually active women younger than 25 and for older women at increased risk of infection. This includes women who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with other partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection.
Regular screening is also recommended for men who have sex with men, as well as their partners.

To avoid getting gonorrhea again, abstain from sex until after you and your sex partner have completed treatment and after symptoms are gone.",,,

Pemphigus vulgaris. This type usually begins with blisters in your mouth and then on your skin or genital mucous membranes. The blisters typically are painful but don't itch. Blisters in your mouth or throat may make it hard to swallow and eat.
Pemphigus foliaceus. This type causes blisters on the chest, back and shoulders. The blisters tend to be more itchy than painful. Pemphigus foliaceus doesn't cause mouth blisters.
Pemphigus is distinct from bullous pemphigoid, which is a blistering skin condition that affects older adults and may cause death.See your doctor if you have blisters inside your mouth or on your skin that don't heal.Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder. Normally, your immune system produces antibodies to fight off harmful invaders, such viruses and bacteria. But in pemphigus, the body produces antibodies that damage cells of your skin and mucous membranes.Pemphigus isn't contagious. In most cases, it's unknown what triggers the disease.Rarely, pemphigus is triggered by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, penicillamine and other drugs.Your risk of pemphigus increases if you're middle-aged or older. The condition tends to be more common in people of Middle Eastern or Jewish descent.Possible complications of pemphigus include:

Creamy white lesions on your tongue, inner cheeks, and sometimes on the roof of your mouth, gums and tonsils
Slightly raised lesions with a cottage cheese-like appearance
Redness, burning or soreness that may be severe enough to cause difficulty eating or swallowing
Slight bleeding if the lesions are rubbed or scraped
Cracking and redness at the corners of your mouth
A cottony feeling in your mouth
Loss of taste
Redness, irritation and pain under dentures (denture stomatitis)
In severe cases, usually related to cancer or a weakened immune system from HIV/AIDS, the lesions may spread downward into your esophagus â€” the long, muscular tube stretching from the back of your mouth to your stomach (Candida esophagitis). If this occurs, you may experience difficulty swallowing and pain or feel as if food is getting stuck in your throat.In addition to the distinctive white mouth lesions, infants may have trouble feeding or be fussy and irritable. They can pass the infection to their mothers during breast-feeding. The infection may then pass back and forth between the mother's breasts and the baby's mouth.Women whose breasts are infected with candida may experience these signs and symptoms:
Unusually red, sensitive, cracked or itchy nipples
Shiny or flaky skin on the darker, circular area around the nipple (areola)
Unusual pain during nursing or painful nipples between feedings
Stabbing pains deep within the breast
If you or your child develops white lesions inside the mouth, see your doctor or dentist.Thrush is uncommon in healthy older children, teenagers and adults, so if thrush develops, see your doctor to determine if further evaluation is needed to check for an underlying medical condition or other cause.Normally, your immune system works to repel harmful invading organisms, such as viruses, bacteria and fungi, while maintaining a balance between ""good"" and ""bad"" microbes that normally inhabit your body. But sometimes these protective mechanisms fail, increasing the number of candida fungus and allowing an oral thrush infection to take hold.The most common type of candida fungus is Candida albicans. Several factors, such as a weakened immune system, can increase your risk of oral thrush.You may have an increased risk of oral thrush infection if any of these issues apply:
Weakened immunity. Oral thrush is more likely to occur in infants and older adults due to reduced immunity. Some medical conditions and treatments can suppress your immune system, such as cancer and its treatments, organ transplantation and required drugs that suppress the immune system, and HIV/AIDS.
Diabetes. If you have untreated diabetes or the disease isn't well-controlled, your saliva may contain large amounts of sugar, which encourages the growth of candida.
Vaginal yeast infections. Vaginal yeast infections are caused by the same fungus that causes oral thrush. You can pass the infection to your baby.
Medications. Drugs such as prednisone, inhaled corticosteroids, or antibiotics that disturb the natural balance of microorganisms in your body can increase your risk of oral thrush.
Other oral conditions. Wearing dentures, especially upper dentures, or having conditions that cause dry mouth can increase the risk of oral thrush.
Oral thrush is seldom a problem for healthy children and adults.For people with lowered immunity, such as from cancer treatment or HIV/AIDS, thrush can be more serious. Untreated oral thrush can lead to more-serious systemic candida infections. If you have a weakened immune system, thrush may spread to your esophagus or other parts of your body.These measures may help reduce your risk of developing candida infections:
Rinse your mouth. If you need to use a corticosteroid inhaler, be sure to rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth after taking your medication.
Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily or as often as your dentist recommends.
Check your dentures. Remove your dentures at night. Make sure dentures fit properly and don't cause irritation. Clean your dentures daily. Ask your dentist for the best way to clean your type of dentures.
See your dentist regularly, especially if you have diabetes or wear dentures. Ask your dentist how often you need to be seen.
Watch what you eat. Try limiting the amount of sugar-containing foods you eat. These may encourage the growth of candida.
Maintain good blood sugar control if you have diabetes. Well-controlled blood sugar can reduce the amount of sugar in your saliva, discouraging the growth of candida.
Treat a vaginal yeast infection as soon as possible.
Treat dry mouth. Ask your doctor about ways to avoid or treat your dry mouth.",,,

Wear underwear, jeans or other clothing that's tight.
Sweat heavily.
Have a weak immune system.
Have athlete's foot.
Tips for reducing the risk of jock itch include:
Stay dry. Keep the groin area and inner thighs dry by drying with a clean towel after showering or exercising. Dry your feet last to avoid spreading athlete's foot to the groin area.
Wear clean clothes. Change your underwear at least once a day or more often if you sweat a lot. It helps to wear underwear made of cotton or other fabric that breathes and keeps the skin drier. Wash workout clothes after each use.
Find the correct fit. Choose underwear, athletic supporters and sports uniforms that fit well. Tight-fitting clothes can chafe your skin and up the risk of jock itch. Try wearing boxer shorts rather than briefs.
Don't share personal items. Don't let others use your clothing, towels or other personal items. Don't borrow such items from others.

For many people, thatâ€™s the only sign of vitiligo. However, other signs and symptoms can develop. The following explains what you may notice.When a person has vitiligo, cells that make pigment are damaged. Because these cells give the skin its color, spots and patches of lighter skin appear. Vitiligo can appear anywhere on a personâ€™s skin, including the genitals.When vitiligo is actively destroying cells that give a personâ€™s skin its color, the patches tend to be pink or tricolor (causing a zone of tan skin between a personâ€™s natural skin color and the white vitiligo). Once vitiligo is no longer active, the patches turn completely white, as shown here.Vitiligo can  cause loss of color in the mouth, on the lips, around the mouth, around the nose, or inside the nose.Skin thatâ€™s lost pigment is more sensitive to sunlight, so it sunburns quickly. Sunburns can also trigger vitiligo, causing it to spread. Thatâ€™s why sun protection is so important.When vitiligo is actively spreading, patches may feel itchy. Otherwise, the spots and patches rarely cause discomfort.Vitiligo can cause a personâ€™s hair to lose its color. When vitiligo appears on the skin, the hair in that area can turn white, as shown in picture A. Vitiligo can also cause a personâ€™s hair to turn prematurely gray, as shown in picture B.Some people develop loss of color on part (or all) of an eyelash or eyebrow.

Your pain interferes with your activities
You also have diabetes or poor feeling in your feet
You also have a weak immune system because of immune-suppressing drugs, HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders
You aren't sure if the growth is a wart
Plantar warts are caused by an infection with HPV in the outer layer of skin on the soles of the feet. The warts develop when the virus enters through tiny cuts, breaks or weak spots on the bottom of the foot. If left untreated, warts can last from a few months to 2 years in children, and several years in in adults.HPV is very common, and more than 100 kinds of the virus exist. But only a few of them cause warts on the feet. Other types of HPV are more likely to cause warts on other areas of your skin or on mucous membranes.Each person's immune system responds differently to HPV. Not everyone who comes in contact with it develops warts. Even people in the same family react to the virus differently.The HPV strains that cause plantar warts aren't highly contagious. So the virus isn't easily spread by direct contact from one person to another. But it thrives in warm, moist places, so you might get the virus by walking barefoot around swimming pools or locker rooms. If the virus spreads from the first site of infection, more warts may grow.Anyone can develop plantar warts, but this type of wart is more likely to affect:
Children and teenagers
People with weak immune systems
People who have had plantar warts before
People who walk barefoot in areas where a wart-causing virus is common, such as locker rooms and swimming pools
When plantar warts cause pain, you may alter your normal posture or gait â€” perhaps without realizing it. Eventually, this change in how you stand, walk or run can cause muscle or joint discomfort.To help prevent plantar warts:
Avoid direct contact with warts. This includes your own warts. Wash your hands carefully after touching a wart.
Keep your feet clean and dry.
Wear sandals or other foot protection when walking around swimming pools, in locker rooms or in gym showers.
Don't pick at or scratch warts.
When using an emery board, pumice stone or nail clipper on your warts, choose one that you don't use on your healthy skin and nails.",,,

The most common types are  Nodular (about 60% of basal cell carcinomas): These types are small, shiny, firm, almost translucent to pink nodules with telangiectases, usually on the face. Ulceration and crusting are common. Superficial (about 30%): These types are red or pink, marginated, thin papules or plaques, commonly on the trunk, that are difficult to differentiate from psoriasis or localized dermatitis. Morpheaform (5 to 10%): These types are flat, scarlike, indurated plaques that can be flesh-colored or light red and have vague borders. Other: Other types are possible. Nodular and superficial basal cell carcinomas can produce pigment (sometimes called pigmented basal cell carcinomas).

Stomach pain, nausea and vomiting
Headache
Muscle pain or spasms
Faintness, dizziness or confusion
Difficulty breathing
Heart problems
The severity of a reaction depends on:
The type and size of the jellyfish
The age, size and health of the person affected, with severe reactions more likely in children
How long the person was exposed to the stingers
How much of the skin is affected
Seek emergency treatment if you have severe symptoms.See your health care provider if your symptoms worsen or the wound shows symptoms of infection.Jellyfish stings are caused by brushing against a jellyfish tentacle. Tentacles have thousands of microscopic barbed stingers. Each stinger has a tiny bulb that holds venom and a coiled, sharp-tipped tube.When you brush against a tentacle, tiny triggers on its surface release the stingers. The tube pierces the skin and releases venom. It affects the area of contact and may enter the bloodstream.Jellyfish that have washed up on a beach may still release venomous stingers if touched.Many types of jellyfish are fairly harmless to humans. Others can cause severe pain and a full-body (systemic) reaction. These jellyfish cause more-serious problems in people:
Box jellyfish. Box jellyfish can cause intense pain and, rarely, life-threatening reactions. The more dangerous species of box jellyfish are in the warm waters of the Pacific and Indian oceans.
Portuguese man-of-war. Also called bluebottle jellyfish, Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish live mostly in warmer seas. This type has a blue or purplish gas-filled bubble that keeps it afloat.
Sea nettle. Common in both warm and cool seawaters.
Lion's mane jellyfish. These are the world's largest jellyfish, with a body diameter of more than 3 feet (1 meter). They're most common in cooler, northern regions of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
Conditions that increase the risk of jellyfish stings:
Swimming when jellyfish appear in large numbers (a jellyfish bloom)
Swimming or diving in jellyfish areas without protective clothing
Playing or sunbathing where jellyfish are washed up on the beach
Swimming in a place known to have many jellyfish
Possible complications of a jellyfish sting include:
Delayed skin reaction, causing blisters, rash or other irritation
Irukandji syndrome, which causes chest and stomach pain, high blood pressure, and heart problems
The following tips can help you avoid jellyfish stings:
Wear a protective suit. When swimming or diving in areas where jellyfish stings are possible, wear a wet suit or other protective clothing. Diving stores sell protective ""skin suits"" or ""stinger suits"" made of thin, high-tech fabric. Consider protective footwear, as stings can also occur while wading in shallow water.
Get information about conditions. Talk to lifeguards, local residents or officials with a local health department before swimming or diving in coastal waters, especially in areas where jellyfish are common.
Avoid water during jellyfish season. Stay out of the water in jellyfish areas when jellyfish numbers are high.",,,

0,Pigmentation Disorders,Albinism,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184,"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:
Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).
Sunburn and no ability to tan.
For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:
Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.
An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.
Legal blindness â€” vision less than 20/200 â€” or complete blindness.
At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision.If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider.Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes.Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.Types of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected.
Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene â€” one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. OCA is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from OCA1 to OCA8. OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.
Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than OCA.
Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes can occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.
Albinism can include skin and eye complications. It also can include social and emotional challenges.Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive.People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced.Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition.People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress.Using the term ""person with albinism"" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. The counselor can explain the available genetic tests.",,,

The other half may experience a heavy vaginal discharge (frothy, yellowish green and alkaline) with a fishy odor. Other symptoms include pain when emptying the bladder (urinating) and when having sex. The walls of the vagina may be swollen and, in serious cases, strawberry colored.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has a five-to seven-day growing period before symptoms appear. This makes it easy to spread between sexual partners. When a woman first is infected, her symptoms may include feeling unwell, swollen lymph nodes in the groin and a fever that usually goes away in a week. Painful ulcers develop on the genitals and heal in about 21 days. The virus comes back from time to time. When it returns, a sense of numbness or tingling may be felt where the ulcer is developing. Recurrences tend to be milder and in one place. Ulcers heal in about 10 days. A person can infect others for about four days after the symptoms have gone away.

Some people experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, muscles and joints, stomachache, swollen lymph glands or a skin rash that lasts one to two weeks.

The virus multiplies in the body for a few weeks or even months before the immune system responds. During this time a person will not test positive for HIV infection but does have the ability to infect others.

The virus uses CD4 T cells, a type of white blood cell that fights infection, to make copies of itself. This process destroys the CD4 T cells, weakening the immune system. Without treatment, a person might experience fevers, night sweats, diarrhea or swollen lymph nodes for several weeks.

HIV progresses to AIDS when:

An HIV-infected individual's CD4 T cell count drops below 200 cells/mm
An HIV-infected individual develops an illness that is very unusual in someone who is not HIV-positive
Opportunistic illnesses that are typical of AIDS include:

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a lung infection
Kaposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer
Cytomegalovirus, an infection that usually affects the eyes
Candida, a fungal infection that can cause thrush, a white film and infections in the throat or vagina

This problem mostly affects teenage boys and men. It usually doesn’t affect children before puberty. Things such as sweating, not drying the feet well after swimming or bathing, wearing tight socks and shoes, and warm weather can play a part in this problem. Symptoms may include:

Whitening of the skin between the toes
Scaling of the feet
Itchy rash on the feet
Blisters on the feet
Jock itch
This problem is also more common in males. It happens more often during warm weather. It is very rare in females. Symptoms of jock itch may include:

Red, ring-like patches in the groin area
Itching in the groin area
Pain in the groin area
It does not usually involve the scrotum.

Scalp ringworm
Scalp ringworm is highly contagious, especially among children. It happens mainly in children between ages 2 and 10. It rarely happens in adults. Symptoms may include:

Red, scaly rash on the scalp
Itchy scalp
Hair loss on the scalp
Rash elsewhere on the body
Bad cases of ringworm of the scalp can also develop into a kerion. A kerion is a thick, pus-filled area on the scalp. It can also cause a fever. This can be caused by an overly active response of the immune system or an allergic reaction to the fungus. It may cause a rash elsewhere on the body and tender lymph nodes in the neck.

Nail infection
This type of ringworm causes the nails to become thickened and deformed. This problem affects the toenails more often than the fingernails. It happens more often in adolescents and adults rather than young children. Symptoms may include thickening of the ends of the nails and yellowing of the nails.

Body ringworm
This skin infection is a ring-like rash that appears anywhere on the body or face. It happens in all ages, but is more common in children. It is also more common in warmer climates. The symptoms may include:

The severity of amyloidosis depends on which organs it affects. It can be life threatening if it causes kidney or heart failure.

If the amyloidosis affects the kidneys, their ability to filter the blood becomes impaired. Protein leaks from the blood into the urine. The loss of protein from the blood can cause fluid to leak out of the blood vessels, resulting in swelling in the feet, ankles and calves. Eventually, there is so much damage to the kidneys that they are not able to remove waste products from the body and they fail.

If amyloidosis affects the heart, the first symptom typically is shortness of breath even with only light activity. Climbing a flight of stairs or walking long distances may be difficult without having to stop. The buildup of amyloid in the heart lessens its ability to fill up with blood between heartbeats. As a result, less blood is pumped with each beat, and the heart is not able to keep up with the body's needs. The buildup of amyloid can also cause problems with the electrical system of the heart, resulting in irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia).

Other effects of amyloidosis include:

A burning sensation as a result of nerves being irritated by the amyloid
Alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea, if the protein deposits affect the nerves that control the bowels
Bowel obstruction
Carpal tunnel syndrome, which causes pain, numbness or tingling in the fingers. Approximately four out of 10 people with amyloidosis develop this syndrome.
Disruption of the nervous system
Dizziness or nearly fainting when standing up too quickly. This can happen if the condition affects the nerves that control blood pressure and a sudden drop in blood pressure occurs when standing up.

This causes growths called tubers to grow in the brain and retina of the eye. Tuberous sclerosis also affects many other organs in the body. It can affect the brain, spinal cord, lungs, heart, kidneys, skin, and bones. It can also cause intellectual disability, developmental delays, seizures, and learning disabilities.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)
This is the more common type of neurofibromatosis. It is also called Von Recklinghausen's disease. The classic symptom of NF1 is light brown patches of pigment on the skin. These are known as cafe-au-lait spots. A child may also have skin tumors that are not cancer (benign). These are called neurofibromas. Neurofibromas are often found growing on the nerves and in organs. There is a higher rate of brain tumors in people with NF. Less than 1 in 100 people with NF1 will have cancer (malignant) in the neurofibromas. An older child may also have Lisch nodules. These are small tumors on the colored part of the eye (iris). These usually do not cause problems. Other symptoms can include hearing loss, headaches, seizures, scoliosis, and facial pain or numbness. Intellectual disability of varying degree may be slightly more common in people with NF1. About half may have a variety of learning problems and attention deficit disorder. Renal artery stenosis and other vascular problems may occur with NF1.

Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)
NF2 affects about 1 in 25,000 people. The symptoms usually appear between ages 18 and 22. The tumors called schwannomas grow on a vestibular nerve branch. These are known as bilateral vestibular schwannomas (BVS). These tumors on the 8th cranial nerve can lead to hearing loss, headaches, problems with facial movements, problems with balance, and trouble walking. A child may have hearing loss. Other signs of NF2 may include seizures, tumors of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord (meningiomas), skin nodules (neurofibromas), and cafe-au-lait spots. 

Schwannomatosis
This type of neurofibromatosis causes schwannomas to grow through the body, but without other symptoms of NF1 or NF2. The main symptom is intense pain that occurs when a schwannoma grows larger or presses on a nerve or nearby tissue. Other symptoms may include numbness, tingling, or weakness in the fingers and toes.

Sturge-Weber disease
The classic symptom of this disease is a mark on a child’s face called a port wine stain. A port wine stain is a flat area on the skin that varies in color from red to dark purple. It is present from birth. It is most often found near or around the eye and forehead. The birthmark is caused by too many tiny blood vessels forming under the skin. There may also be related brain abnormalities on the same side of the brain as the face lesion. A child may also have seizures, muscle weakness, changes in vision, and intellectual disability. A child may also have increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) at birth. Sturge-Weber disease does not affect the other organs of the body.                ",,,

0,Light Diseases and Disorders of Pigmentation,Albinism,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184,"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:
Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).
Sunburn and no ability to tan.
For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:
Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.
An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.
Legal blindness â€” vision less than 20/200 â€” or complete blindness.
At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision.If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider.Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes.Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.Types of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected.
Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene â€” one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. OCA is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from OCA1 to OCA8. OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.
Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than OCA.
Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes can occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.
Albinism can include skin and eye complications. It also can include social and emotional challenges.Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive.People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced.Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition.People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress.Using the term ""person with albinism"" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. The counselor can explain the available genetic tests.",,,

Your age and sex. The condition can affect anyone at any age, though it's more common between 20 and 50 years of age.
Having inflammatory bowel disease. People with a digestive tract disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Having arthritis. People with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Having a blood disorder. People with acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplasia or a myeloproliferative disorder are at increased risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
Possible complications of pyoderma gangrenosum include infection, scarring, uncontrolled pain, depression and loss of mobility.You can't totally prevent pyoderma gangrenosum. If you have the condition, try to avoid injuring your skin. Injury or trauma to your skin, including from surgery, can provoke new ulcers to form. It may also help to control any underlying condition that may be causing the ulcers.",,,

In infancy the hoarseness is expressed as a weak cry. The voice abnormalities persist throughout life and can ultimately cause difficulty speaking or complete loss of speech. Involvement of the throat, tonsils, and lips can result in breathing problems and upper respiratory tract infections. Deposits in the tongue can result in a thick and shortened tongue. They can also thicken the band of tissue that connects the tongue to the bottom of the mouth (frenulum), making it difficult to extend the tongue. The tongue may also have a smooth appearance due to damage to the taste buds.

A characteristic feature of lipoid proteinosis is the presence of multiple tiny, bead-like bumps lining the upper and lower eyelids along the lash line. These bumps are known as moniliform blepharosis. They may cause eyeball irritation or itching but generally do not impair vision.

The skin and mucous membranes are often fragile in children with lipoid proteinosis, leading to bleeding and scabbing following minor trauma. These problems often first appear in infancy in the mouth and on the face and limbs. Over time, these scabs form blisters and scars. Deposits accumulate in the skin, which causes the skin to become thickened and yellowish in color.

A small, rough growth on the bottom of your foot, usually at the base of the toes or on the ball or heel
On brown and Black skin, the growth may be lighter than unaffected skin
Hard, thickened skin (callus) over a spot on the skin, where a wart has grown inward
Black pinpoints, which are small clotted blood vessels commonly called wart seeds
A cluster of growths on the sole of the foot (mosaic warts)
A growth that interrupts the normal lines and ridges in the skin of your foot
Pain or tenderness when walking or standing
See your health care provider for the growth on your foot if:
The growth is bleeding, painful or changes in shape or color
You've tried treating the wart, but it persists, multiplies or comes back after clearing for a time (recurs)
Your pain interferes with your activities
You also have diabetes or poor feeling in your feet
You also have a weak immune system because of immune-suppressing drugs, HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders
You aren't sure if the growth is a wart
Plantar warts are caused by an infection with HPV in the outer layer of skin on the soles of the feet. The warts develop when the virus enters through tiny cuts, breaks or weak spots on the bottom of the foot. If left untreated, warts can last from a few months to 2 years in children, and several years in in adults.HPV is very common, and more than 100 kinds of the virus exist. But only a few of them cause warts on the feet. Other types of HPV are more likely to cause warts on other areas of your skin or on mucous membranes.Each person's immune system responds differently to HPV. Not everyone who comes in contact with it develops warts. Even people in the same family react to the virus differently.The HPV strains that cause plantar warts aren't highly contagious. So the virus isn't easily spread by direct contact from one person to another. But it thrives in warm, moist places, so you might get the virus by walking barefoot around swimming pools or locker rooms. If the virus spreads from the first site of infection, more warts may grow.Anyone can develop plantar warts, but this type of wart is more likely to affect:
Children and teenagers
People with weak immune systems
People who have had plantar warts before
People who walk barefoot in areas where a wart-causing virus is common, such as locker rooms and swimming pools
When plantar warts cause pain, you may alter your normal posture or gait â€” perhaps without realizing it. Eventually, this change in how you stand, walk or run can cause muscle or joint discomfort.To help prevent plantar warts:
Avoid direct contact with warts. This includes your own warts. Wash your hands carefully after touching a wart.
Keep your feet clean and dry.
Wear sandals or other foot protection when walking around swimming pools, in locker rooms or in gym showers.
Don't pick at or scratch warts.
When using an emery board, pumice stone or nail clipper on your warts, choose one that you don't use on your healthy skin and nails.",,,

The skin erosions usually start on the face and chest before spreading to other parts of the body. In most affected individuals, the condition also damages the mucous membranes, including the lining of the mouth and the airways, which can cause trouble with swallowing and breathing. The painful blistering can also affect the urinary tract and genitals. SJS/TEN often affects the eyes as well, causing irritation and redness of the conjunctiva, which are the mucous membranes that protect the white part of the eye and line the eyelids, and damage to the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea).

Severe damage to the skin and mucous membranes makes SJS/TEN a life-threatening disease. Because the skin normally acts as a protective barrier, extensive skin damage can lead to a dangerous loss of fluids and allow infections to develop. Serious complications can include pneumonia, overwhelming bacterial infections (sepsis), shock, multiple organ failure, and death. About 10 percent of people with Stevens-Johnson syndrome die from the disease, while the condition is fatal in up to 50 percent of those with toxic epidermal necrolysis.

Among people who survive, long-term effects of SJS/TEN can include changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), dryness of the skin and mucous membranes (xerosis), excess sweating (hyperhidrosis), hair loss (alopecia), and abnormal growth or loss of the fingernails and toenails.

They can then offer treatment, if needed.MS-related visual problems will often improve on their own, usually within a few weeks, so you may not need any treatment.If your symptoms are particularly severe, you may be prescribed steroids to help speed up recovery.If you have problems with involuntary eye movements, medicine such as gabapentin can sometimes help.Some people with double vision need help from ophthalmologists (eye specialists).Muscle spasms and stiffness (spasticity) can be improved with physiotherapy.Â TechniquesÂ like stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted.If your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles.This will usually be either baclofen or gabapentin, although there are alternative medicines, such as tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam and dantrolene.These medicines all have side effects, such as dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea, so discuss which of these would be best for you with yourÂ specialist MS nurse or GP.If these medicines are not effective, you may be offered a 4-week trial of nabiximols (Sativex). This is a cannabis-based medicine sprayed into the mouth.Find out more about medical cannabisIf medicines do not help, you may be referred to a specialist service that helps people manage muscle spasms and stiffness, called a spasticity service.Mobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity, but they can also be caused by muscle weakness, or problems with balance or dizziness.If you have problems with mobility, you might benefit from:an exercise programmeÂ supervised by a physiotherapistspecial exercises called vestibular rehabilitation if you have problems with balancemedicine for dizziness or tremorsmobility aids, such as a walking stick or occasionally a wheelchairhome adaptations, such as stair lifts or railingsAnÂ occupational therapistÂ can carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations that may be of help.Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to your nerves, and is usually sharp and stabbing.It can also occur in the form of extreme skin sensitivity or a burning sensation.This type of pain can be treated using medicines such as duloxetine, gabapentin or carbamazepine, or with a medicine called amitriptyline.This is an older type ofÂ antidepressant, but these days it's mainly used for pain control.Living with MS can cause stresses and strains to the muscles and joints in your body.A physiotherapist may be able to help withÂ this pain by suggesting exercise techniques or better seating positions.If your pain is more severe, you may be prescribed painkillers.Alternatively, you may have a device that stimulates your nerves called a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine.If you experienceÂ problems with thinking and memory, you may be referred to a neuropsychologist and an occupational therapist, who can help assess your problems and suggest ways to manage them.If you experience emotional outbursts, such as laughing or crying for no apparent reason, you should be assessed by a specialist like a clinical psychologist.They may suggest treatment with an antidepressant.People with MS who have depression can also be treated with antidepressants or therapy, such as CBT.If you often feel anxious or worried, you may be prescribed antidepressants or benzodiazepines, which are a type of tranquilliser that have a calming effect.MenÂ with MS who find it hard to obtain or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction) may be prescribedÂ medicine toÂ temporarily increase the blood flow to the penis,Â such as sildenafil (Viagra).
